    "Long short-term memory (LSTM) units (or blocks) are a building unit for layers of a recurrent neural network (RNN). An RNN composed of LSTM units is often called an LSTM network. A common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate and a forget gate. The cell is responsible for \"remembering\" values over arbitrary time intervals; hence the word \"memory\" in LSTM. Each of the three gates can be thought of as a \"conventional\" artificial neuron, as in a multi-layer (or feedforward) neural network: that is, they compute an activation (using an activation function) of a weighted sum. Intuitively, they can be thought as regulators of the flow of values that goes through the connections of the LSTM; hence the denotation \"gate\". There are connections between these gates and the cell.\n",

       "4  I don't know what Dr. Goldberg was like before  moving to Arizona, but let me tell you, STAY AWAY from this doctor and this office. I was going to Dr. Johnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better and they will not be there when you really ...   \n",

I think I was one of his 1st patients when he started at MHMG. He's been great over the years and is really all about the big picture. It is because of him, not my now former gyn Dr. Markoff, that I found out I have fibroids. He explores all options with you and is very patient and understanding. He doesn't judge and asks all the right questions. Very thorough and wants to be kept in the loop on every aspect of your medical health and your life.\n",

       "4    I don't know what Dr. Goldberg was like before  moving to Arizona, but let me tell you, STAY AWAY from this doctor and this office. I was going to Dr. Johnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break!

I received an $800.00 bill for the blood work. I can't pay for my bill because I'm a student and don't have any cash flow at this current time.

We got in for free thanks to the promoter hookup we got. First you can't take glassware from Moon down to Playboy. Security will take your glass and transfer the contents over to a plastic cocktail cup making you feel like you are a four year old when all of the big kids downstairs have real glassware.\\n\\nThere are a couple of tables here to gamble along with some video poker machines at the bar in the back of the club. The atmosphere here is relaxed and seems to cater to an older (40+) crowd. the bunnies here looked miserable, and complained about working. YOU ARE A PLAYBOY BUNNIE!! For the love of god TRY to be happy!\\n\\nI wouldn't come back here if I had to pay to get in, Playboy is rather small, though intimate. There is limited seating available here, and little to no dancing. Stick to here if you want to be able to hear your date and have a relaxing time. Go somewhere else if you are looking to party it up.\n",

      "Stamoolis Brothers is one of the Strip District storefronts, specializing in Greek and Mediterranean imports.  They have a good selection of olives, a decent cheese selection, a variety of ready-made dips and spreads which are pretty tasty, and some harder-to-find specialty items like rose water, pomegranate molasses, different grinds of bulgur wheat, bulk fava beans, etc.  You can also get packaged bulk nuts, dried fruits, etc.  When I go in here, it's usually because I'm looking for feta cheese or Greek-style yogurt.\\n\\nThis place is pretty good.  A couple times I've had some problems getting yogurt here, since they have a tendency to keep the yogurt on the shelf until it's almost at its sell-by date, but on the other hand, they have the cheapest price on Fage yogurt that I've seen in town thus far.  My mom loves a lot of their dips and spreads, so I get snacks from here a lot when she's in town.  The one caution I have (besides the yogurt) is that they sell an inferior brand of canned tomatoes here, which gives off a very strong flavor of metal and ruins your meal.\n",

Food was just really mediocre, not even hot.  The hashbrowns taste pre-cut and frozen.  The \\\"real maple syrup\\\" is just a maple syrup blend.  I could make a lot better food myself.  We had pancakes, bacon, and the wolf pack.  All the prices were way too high with food that's more on par with denny's.  Would rather IHOP across the street.

For example, the salmon is typically undercooked and lacking seasoning. I love salmon so I tried it a few times hoping it would improve, but it didn't. Last time, instead of salmon I ordered a grilled wedge salad. It was covered in oil which made it inedible. \\n\\nThey also almost always mess something up in our take out order. Usually it is something small like giving us regular fries instead of garlic fries, but hey, we pay extra for the garlic! It is frustrating.  \\n\\nIn my opinion, the food at the Coffee Shop next door is much better.\n",

      "So I have been to Hickory Tavern many many times before. I am actually suprised I havent reviewed it until now. The view of the city is incredible and it is conveniently located in the Met, so we usually hit it before a Trader Joe's grocery shopping trip! \\n\\nUsually my husband and I get the Build Your Own Salads. 6 ingredients for $9. The oriental dressing is amazing and bacon and avocado on a salad is just A-mazing. In addition, I love that Hickory has Red Oak on tap. They have alot of local beers on draft and I love that about a restaurant.\\n\\nHowever, this review is more specifically directed to a situation we had today for lunch at HT. My husband and I decided to grab our typical BYO salads. I don't know what was going on but it took a long time to get our food. 25-30 minutes to get a salad is kinda crazy (I mean there wasnt even any cooked meat on it.....all raw ingredients!).Our waitress was super sweet though and came by saying that she had no idea why we hadn't gotten our food yet and that it should be there soon. We finally got our salads and dug in.....yummy dressing! However, about half way into the salad, my husband looks up and pulls out a piece of cardboard from his salad. It was about 2 inches by a half inch. Gross. We have both worked in the food industry and know that those boxes are dragged across the floor when being brought in. All I could picture is that nasty cardboard piece being spread across that whole (since the dressing was tossed into the salad). \\n\\nThe waitress was, once again, very sweet and didnt really know what to do and grabbed her manager. The manager came out and was talking about boxing up the salad to go. I am assuming she was talking about boxing up a new salad and not the one with the cardboard in it....I dont know. She also offered us a free brownie. Honestly, we didnt really want any other food at the time. They did comp his salad (which was very sweet, hence the 2 stars instead of 1) and charged me for mine. It was just kinda weird. I mean she did apologize but it just came across like it wasnt a big deal. \\n\\nKinda frustrating that we had this happen cause we LOVED going to Hickory Tavern in the past! I'm not sure if we will be back soon, simply cause I keep picturing that nasty piece of cardboard. Plus, there are so many other places to eat in the Met!\n",

      "On 28 June 2013 I checked into the Riviera Hotel and casino until 5 July 2013. After being placed in a downgraded room because my room wasn't available I got settled into room 3533. \\nOn 30 June 2013 I went to turn on the floor lamp inside the room and I got a very powerful electric shock. My right hand and arm has very little feeling other than tingling now. I reported the incident immediately to the front desk. A security guard came up to my room and I filed an incident report. She assured me that Risk Management would call me. She took the lamp and told me maintenance would replace the lamp. The lamp wasn't replaced. After going to the ER I was diagnosed with Electric Shock Injury and was told feeling may never come back. I tried calling risk management every day. Finally after 2 days I went to the front desk and demanded to speak to someone regarding my injury. The manager, Debbie, came up and offered to refund my resort fees totaling $115.00 to make up for me losing the feeling in my arm by their faulty equipment in the room. They then upgraded me to the room I was supposed to have the whole time since I paid for an upgraded room. On 4 July 2013 housekeeping came to the room around 11 am. I told her I didn't need housekeeping and she said \\\"ok\\\" and walked away. We left the room around 1:00 and returned around 2:30pm. Upon returning to the room none of the 4 keys we had worked. I went down to the front desk and they gave me 4 more keys. I went back to my room and those keys didn't work. I went back down but this time to the bell desk. I explained what happened and how I already got 4 new keys. He said he'd help and he followed me to my room. His key didn't work. He said something had to be wrong with the lock or mechanism so he left and went to engineering. 30 minutes later 2 security guards (1 male in a black suit and the female security who originally took my injury report) arrived at my room. They told me I was locked out of my room because housekeeping came in to clean and saw my BB gun I had in my room. He told me firearms aren't allowed in the building. I had kept my BB gun in my safe which I kept locked. I told the security how I had told housekeeping I didn't need service earlier. I also told him how my BB gun, which isn't a firearm because it does not use combustion to fire a projectile instead uses air, was locked in my safe and asked how the maid saw my gun and also why was she coming back after I told her I didn't want her in my room. He then told me I was to leave the premises and was banned or \\\"86'd\\\". It took security an additional 30 minutes to get into my room because the door wasn't unlocking. The security guard kept trying to egg me on and asking \\\"Do you have a chip on your shoulder?\\\" \\\"Are you mad?\\\" \\\"Why are you mad?\\\" He had to be asked to leave by the other security guards because he wouldn't stop egging me on. Once inside I saw my safe had been pried open, my BB gun was sitting on top of the safe and the do not disturb sign that was on the door was sitting next to the safe. All the money I had in the safe was taken. I requested to file a report and I was told Risk Management would call me Monday. They never called. They didn't refund me for my extra night stay. I filed a police report with Las Vegas Metro Police. I will never stay at the Riviera. I will never recommend anyone, not even my worst enemy to stay at the Riviera Hotel and Casino Las Vegas!!\\n\\nAttached is a video taken while security tried to fix the door the broke.https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10151779810399913&l=1311073713539322341\n",

      "First, I came here with a coupon from one of those entertainment books my daughter's school sells.  Many items were excluded including the lunch specials and the menudo.  Apparently, to be truly Mexican you have to enjoy eating a cow's stomach in soup -- menudo.  So Eli M. and I vowed to return one day.  Ah, yes, I am not even a little Mexican, but suffer from a proclivity to try unusual foods others turn up their noses at.  Enter Groupon.\\n\\nHaving purchased a Groupon that excluded the lunch specials, but not the menudo, Eli M. and I, with some friends in tow, made our return.  I told Eli M. that menudo costing less than $7 seemed a little dubious given the extensive perpetuation process he described, but we didn't let a little thing like that deter us. As the menudo was cheaply priced, I also ordered a chorizo burrito a la carte.  I was trying to max out the Groupon, and soup, regardless of the contents, didn't seem that filling.  Eli M. doesn't eat much and was satisfied with just a medium sized bowl of menudo. In terms of taste however, he said that it was okay.  He said it was too greasy, which is what our friends also said of their food.  Moreover, they have Pepsi instead of Coke.  And the location is a bit out off the quick lunch radius.  So, it looks like Eli M. and I will max out at two visits to Susie's.  Thanks for the menudo.\n",

Again, I felt like I wasted 10$. The sauce was terribly bland, too sweet and too sour at the same time. Also, they used way too much celery. I was very disappointed and felt like I wasted my time and money. I felt this place was WAAAY to over-prized for what they offer. And I didn't feel that it tasted authentic or refreshing like Vietnamese food usually tastes.  The menu was just the same as in Lang Van. I did see Asian people in the restaurant. So, it must be somewhat decent. The food doesn't have a \\\"restaurant feel\\\", but more an \\\"American-Asian fast food feel\\\".They should restructure the portions and prizing.

The salad was light and the orange dressing was a refreshing surprise.  The enchiladas were drenched with a velvety poblano sauce, and combined with the mushrooms, the enchiladas just slid down my throat.  The borracho beans were a smoky kidney beans with a hint of chili powder.  Oh, and don't skip the chips and fire roasted salsa; it's so good that you'll want to drink it straight from the bowl.\\n\\nFor dessert, we shared the Ancho Brownie, garnished with pepita ice cream.

      "Papa John himself would be disappointed in the level of quality in the pizza's (3) that I received on 08/03/2013. I placed an order online from the 1010 E Desert Inn Rd. location for the special that they had for 3 medium/ 3 topping pizza's thinking that I will do something special for my wife, since she didn't eat anything at work. This was my first time I ever ate Papa John's. Everything was great when ordering and the delivery driver calling to let me know that she is 10 minutes away. When she arrive at our hotel at 7:20PM, I gave her a tip and accepted the pizza's without ever looking at them. As soon as I sat down with my wife in our hotel room, we looked at the pizza's and it looked like the pizza's were cold (cheese getting firm as if it were sitting out long). I called the Papa John's location and spoke with the manager around 7:30PM. He had offered to get new ones sent. I called back at 7:42PM asking the manager if we should give the old pizza's back to the driver that is coming to drop of the new pizza's, he then said that we didn't need to. So my wife and I were so hungry and waited for the pizza's to arrive. We had the opportunity to stare at the cold pizza's and realized how skimpy the toppings were and one of the pizza's looked burnt on the bottom. One pizza for example, had anchovies, chicken and onions. We couldn't even see the chicken and onions, so it looked like an anchovy pizza. I had time to take nice pictures of them. I called the Papa John's location again around 8:32PM. I was so upset that we haven't received the pizza's yet. They said that the driver went to the wrong address and should be there shortly and that the pizza's were piping hot out of the oven. I doubt that they were piping hot, especially arriving late. At 8:44PM, the driver called me and said that he was outside the hotel. I told him to send the pizza's back because it was late already, one hour and 14 minutes later from the time that I called at 7:30PM to get the replacement pizza's. I filled out a feedback form online at the Papa John's website the same night. It is already 08/07/13 and I still haven't received a call from who ever it may concern. I am sorry, but the way that Papa John talks about his business is different from what I experienced. The quality presented by his employee's do not match up to what his values are. I can't say that there were better ingredients if there were hardly any topping on the pizza's.\n",

I had a 12:40AM to ATL Monday morning.  Leaving Hohokam Park around 9PM (about 6-7 miles from SH), I didn't get to the f'n car rental center (a whole different story) until 10:30.  \\n\\nWho's genius idea was it to close the airport exit and re-direct traffic from a 4 lane to a one-lane bottleneck into the airport?  That could have been the dumbest, most inefficient thing I have seen since DC shut the interstate near RFK.  Traffic was unbelievable.  And I didn't realize it took another 15 minutes to get to the car rental \\\"center\\\".\\n\\nAfter finally getting to the terminal, check in was slow, considering the amount of people they should have been expecting (they had red-eyes going to CHI, JFK, and ATL, amongst other places).  Getting to security was ridiculous- I would have rather gotten a handy from TSA then the circus they were running.  Apparently, waving my sunscreen in the air \\\"who's is this?\\\"  I should have told them it was my buttplug.   I told them, they said I could check it, but I couldn't let it go.  Cya, sunscreen.  \\n\\nAnother fascinating aspect was I had my cough syrup, hand sanitizer, and my lighter on me.  They could care less about the lighter.  The hand-gel - gone.  And my syrup, they made me take my stuff, and open it, they were testing it for God-only-knows. They didn't care about checking my ID to make sure the contents were mine though, just to make sure it wasn't on their list?  Is that not ass-backwards?\\n\\nFinally getting through, there wasn't shit open to eat or shop, a big no-no for people trying to get the hell home- I mean after taking 2 hours to go 6 miles that gets you hungry!\\n\\nThe actual airport itself was dated in some parts, but it was clean, its only saving grace.\\n\\nIMO, this place has a long ways to go to be a well oiled machine, which is a huge disappoinment being a gateway to the west.\n",

Upon arrival I was told it does NOT cover the cut of a lab and I would incur an extra fee, I was slightly irritated since I had already spoken to someone prior to my purchase but I said ok and asked how much... The response was \\\"I didn't know you had a groupon, I'm not sure, I'll let you know\\\" I didn't like it being left open ended but thought it couldn't be more than $10-20 and I would still be getting a good deal so it's fine and I left her. Let me also add here that prior to leaving and when filling out my paperwork I alerted them my lab is older and her hips are bad to please be careful. A few hours later we came back to pick her up, I was told I needed to pay $35 more for the cut and because they had to hold her up to shave her. That's literally double the cost of the groupon I purchased! Also, my lab is old but she can stand and I have NEVER had a problem or been charged extra for grooming her bc of her age. We were told the normal price for a groom of a lab was $65 (we would be paying $70) and to consider it as getting the spa package for free which was actually supposed to already have been a part of the groupon I had purchased. I asked to speak with the groomer bc I was not paying an extra $35... I agreed to pay extra for the cut but I refused to pay double, I was told she had no idea I had a groupon (not sure why that even matters, a groom is a groom regardless of the payment) no idea it was a lab, or that she was older. I clearly stated a lab when I made my appt, I also let Nathalie know about her hips when I signed her in. The groomer finally agreed and said I did not have to pay the extra $35 but I'm still in awe of the extra money they tried to get out of us. They should not run a groupon if you can't afford to take the loss on money to gain new clients, I felt scammed. I also have to add the job was not done well... After this \\\"spa package\\\" and bath she came home with goop still in her eye, she had some kind of gross something on her tail, and there were several areas of long hair left that was uncut. Nathalie was nice in greeting us, but the groomer was awful and I don't think we will be back...\n",

Was there value for the meal? Sure.  Was it good enough to justify ever eating that much of it?  Absolutely not!  It was decently spicy but, more so, it was just hot.

Their system was down so they did everything manually, approved it and I was on my way. I returned the car three days later and their computers are STILL down. They receive the car and hand write me a bill saying the card that I gave them would be charged.\\n\\n The next day I look at my statements and the card I gave them has been charged. I look at my bank statement and they've also charged me a deposit for a rental on my debit card, the day after I returned the car! I called them to get it straightened out because i figure it's simple human error because of their systems being down and that they can just drop the charge on my visa. \\n\\n I call them and they insist that i'm mistaken and I must have given them a visa. They look at the imprint of the card and go figure; it's the AMEX I paid for the rental with. Too bad though, they charged my debit card for it and they claim they can't do anything about it now (even though it's still pending). They also have a charge on my AMEX, so I don't have access to those funds either. The thing is; I never presented them my visa and they don't have a swipe, imprint or record of it other than via Orbitz. \\n\\n The people at the counter both times were great, but the manager Albert was rude and seemed put out that I wanted him to look into this. He had someone else call me back, presumably because he didn't want to admit his mistake, and essentially tell me to call their billing department on Monday to have them charge the Amex for the final bill and they'll refund  the other card in 5-7 days.\\n\\nPS: the convertible I rented was beaten into the ground.

      "Everything you'd expect from a high end casino's buffet: Huge selection, decent quality foods, and overpriced admission.  I'm not saying that it was a bad experience; On the contrary, I enjoyed my visit.  But to me, in the end the food doesn't justify the price.  I'll elaborate.\\n\\nAs I mentioned, the food selection is quite extensive and diverse.  It seems every major nationality and ethnicity is represented somewhere in the buffet.  I'll use my gluttony as an example: My first plate consisted of asian-style stir fry and meats, with rice and an Asian soup.  My second plate was build-it-yourself tacos, with middle eastern style doughy stuff and meats.  My third plate was typical American, steak and trip-tip with potatoes and corn. The dessert section is fairly large too- lots of gelatos, cakes, and other sweet treats.  Overall, most of the food quality would range between very good to excellent.\\n\\nNow, even though the buffet is tasty and diverse, I still have a few negatives I can't quite get over:\\nPrice- The buffet is great, but it's quality isn't much different from other buffets on the strip.  For example, the quality equals that of Planet Hollywood's buffet, and PH comes in at around $10 cheaper per person, with a shorter wait time. Which leads me to my next point...\\nService- If you come during meal times, you're going to wait.  Unless you're a VIP, you wait to pay and wait again to be seated.  From the time we got in line until we got seated took about 40 minutes, which is kind of crazy for a lunch.  And after you're seated, if you're thirsty you are at the mercy of a server and must wait for beverages and refills. Which in our experience, was very lacking and slow. I went through two plates of food with an empty drink, and only received a refill when I flagged down a different passing server. \\n\\nSo in conclusion, the food was very good and the selection was great.  The price was steep and the service lackluster.  Next time I do a Vegas buffet, I'll probably try somewhere else where the cost is a bit more in line with the value.\n",

The booths are so comfy, you may never want to leave and that could be very dangerous here! Unfortunately I am with the minority on this one after this visit. I wanted to make it here for brunch but that didn't happen so dinner it was. There wasn't too many other parties it was pretty empty in there when we arrived. Off season and no Sommelier this day. We sat inside first and ordered some Peroni (am I the only one who finds an Italian beer here a little weird?) to drink. Some tomato bread which the server promptly corrected me \\\"You mean Pan con Tomate?!? Yes I wont touch that one. Then the Tortilla Espanola I tried those at the OYE already and they were delicous I would probably come here just for those!\\n\\nNow we had forgotten there was happy hour and were told it was only on the patio or at the bar, we thought it was a tad odd considering the place was so empty. So we decided we'd like to move out on the patio mind you HH was almost over. So the waitress tells us that we would have to close out the bill then move outside where she would be our server again. Huh?? The hub asked what he thought was a manager if it would be a problem he was just a waiter and told us \\\"Yes that will be a problem\\\" so after a lot of looking at each other like WTF our waitress finally gets the manager please forgive me I am so bad w names people. He came over and told us we didnt have to move if we wanted that we could order off the HH menu. Thank you! At that time we decided to move outside anyway for the view, they helped move all our stuff over after that dilemma everything went pretty smoothly.\\n\\nWe continued with the soft lettuce it was really good the almonds were awesome but I cant say anything special about the sauce unfortunately. Next came the calamari def worth trying its a good size portion and worth every penny. The shrimp I will probably pass on next time they were ok not worth 4 for $16 eh I did not think they were that special tasting but they were big. Then there was the piquillo pepper it was stuffed with tuna I was expecting raw tuna or something not canned, it wasn't spicy at all. Think tuna salad but there was capers instead of pickles it wasnt anything special go for something else or I'd suggest it for lunch more than anything. We did not have any dessert nothing really appealed to us on the menu so we just ordered another round of drinks the mojito I had for desert was ok as well.\\n\\nThis place reminds me of the Scottsdale stereo type where I was not blown away by the food and the normal overpriced drinks I can see this being a neutral watering hole where the cougar and trout come out of their lairs to play simultaneously during the cooler months. I did not see anyone dressed up so I am guessing thats more of a night thing. Overall this experience was 2 stars the ambiance and the drinks get one more. Super Strong drinks here and with the possibility that I ordered the wrong things this time I will be back to try more stuff and figure out what I like.

I ordered the 2 drumsticks and a waffle. #10. It was awesome of course. Don't forget the jar of Kool Aid. Yum. So good. Great service too. Everyone is always really nice. This is the place where I first tried grits. I have heard people complain about grits in general but these were great. Add a little honey and they are almost perfect. Maybe some cinnamon would put them over the top. This one of those places where the food is so good you can't stop eating even though you are full.\\nThe place was very clean and the pictures on the wall are great. This is one of my favorite places and I will be back to this location or the Scottsdale one over and over again.\n",

You can easily access many of the other Strip properties from here.\\n\\n- The view of the Bellagio Fountains.  As I described in another review, we love the Fountains @ the Bellagio.  You can request a room with a Strip/Fountain view and if you're lucky enough to get it, you'll be treated to a wonderful scene.\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/fountains-of-bellagio-las-vegas#hrid:5mSBxtxJXkCKC2b1hRys8A\\n\\n- Monorail station.  The monorail station stops at Bally's, which is next door to Paris and easily accessed.  I'm a fan of the Monorail, so it's always a bonus to be near a station.\\n\\n- Decent food selection.  One of our favorite restaurants in the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  While we don't eat here often, we make it a point to do so if we have a weekend getaway here @ Paris.

My advice to any guy going to a club in Vegas, you NEED a table, otherwise you will be standing at the bar looking like a complete ZERO getting poked with side yabs and percodan hardons from various blowjobs and douchebags. \\n\\nArriving at the Venetian, standing atop the grand staircase outside the hallowed gateway into Tao, my buddy spent the first ten minutes on the phone w/our connection inside. The line was ridiculous (there were several lines, like trying to merge into the Lincoln Tunnel, lines for the haves and have nots), and we still had to grease our way in - again, we are dudes in Vegas, it is to be expected (and worth it to skip being swallowed up in the mass of would be clubgoers, waiting and waiting, babbling on their cell phones, baying like madmen in the DUCHESS OF MALFI). \\n\\nOnce inside, you are jostled through the entry tunnel, lined with bathtubs full of rose petals, through the bar area, and up another flight of stairs into the club proper.  The dance floor is ebbing and flowing like a turbulant sea, lights flashing overhead like heat lightening, and there are people EVERYWHERE.  At this point you've just wrecked your perfactly sculptured hair and wrinkled your pressed shirt as you are squeezing through the sweaty throng of nobodies who were either too cheap or too stupid to get a table, as you step on feet looking for a way out of this and saying, \\\"imagine if we didn't have a table, fuck this!\\\"\\n\\nWhen we finally got to our table, it was time to take a well deserved breath of relief and watch as the hot server, done up like a sex slave, pours out the vodka.  Other people with tables included some strange eurotrash dude that resembled a more junked out version of Keith Richards (if you can imagine that!) wearing a crushed black velvet tux with red silk shirt underneath, engaged in a very involved conversation with a hot piece of ass that was no doubt a RENTAL.  Again, dudes, be prepared to spend great boatloads of money to impress the broads here.  It takes more than a good line, you will actually need to LAY OUT the line of coke on the American Express Black to even get one of these harpies to raise an eyebrow.  \\n\\nAll in all, it was like a night spent in the Temple of Doom, minus the annoying lady that was sleeping with the director singing ANYTHING GOES in Chinese.\n",

If you prefer the huge rooms of the Venetian or Ceasar's, this is not the place for you - it's guest rooms are standard hotel size, but it's the decor that sets them apart.  Also, if you'd like a suite to have a few friends over for a laid back get-together, the Artisan does have a smallish, similarly decorated suite with a pool table available for half the cost of the huge suites on the Strip.  I also remember the music out by the pool being particularly good - despite the pool being kinda between overpasses, they did a nice job with it and the cabanas.  Oh!

Let's just say that there is a reason the cliche exists of the old, fat, balding assholes with ponytails.  The group that trolls the sales counter are a bunch of scumbags.  Went in to buy something that they were selling for a total of $107.00, and they told me that if I waited a week they were having a giant sale and I could get it as an even better deal.  So I rolled the dice and took the chance.  Low and behold, it was still there, I was very happy, but when I went to pay, the item had suddenly risen in price by almost $75.00.  You could still see the level of dust that was there from how long it was sitting on the shelf.  You could also see the sticker over the old one.  When I called them on their shit, they didn't know whether to shit or wind their watch.  A bunch of deceitful assholes.  I'm willing to bet that it's still sitting there.

      "I fly - a lot - and I have to say that Sky Harbor is one of the better airports in the country. It's one of the highest volume airports yet it's reasonably well organized. I've heard that about 75% of the air traffic flows through Terminal 4 (that's where US Air and SouthWest fly out of). \\n\\nIf you've going to fly out of Phoenix very often my advice would be to start using US Air or SouthWest because a) it's a hub for both of them and b) you'll have much better flight choices and c) because of the competition, the prices tend to be better. The other terminals, by comparison, are nearly deserted. Terminals 2 and 3 have very limited food choices. Terminal 4 has improved a lot in that regard. \\n\\nThere is a lot of parking available, both on site and off site. The off site parking, naturally, is cheaper but you have to wait for the buses to bring you to the terminal. Compared to other airports of comparable size the on site parking is not that expensive. If it's a business trip and you are getting reimbursed for the parking, just park on site and save yourself the hassle. Honestly, the best way to get in and out of Sky Harbor is not to drive at all but to use a transportation service. I'm not talking about Stupper-Shuttle - don't get me started on them - but a real sedan service that will drop you at the curb and meet you at the security gate when you arrive back home. \\n\\nIf you can, print your boarding pass at home rather than waiting in line at the airport. The airline clubs, in my view, are a waste of money. As another reviewer pointed out, the wi-fi access is now free at Sky Harbor. I used to belong to the US Air club but let it lapse. The snacks are not that good, they were charging for drinks. Unless you are regularly connecting through Phoenix how much time are you really going to spend in the airport? Now if you're connecting and have a long layover then it might be worthwhile but otherwise I'd skip it. \\n\\nI got a laptop stolen here once so a word about security. If you have a laptop computer, put it through the x-ray machine last and don't take your eye off it for a moment. Particularly if it's very busy.\n",

After playing telephone tag for two days, with a package delivery pending the next day, I physically went to the site and spoke with Adrian Maldonado. He backed his driver completely, but told me that the immediate supervisor would be with him when he delivered my package and that the driver would personally apologize to me.\\n\\nThe driver, who I now know is named Clark, didn't say a word until I asked him to apologize. I was told what a good driver he was for the past 15 years and that he would not be parking in handicapped spaces anymore and I had nothing to worry about in the future because he would do a good job. I had his bosses guarantee. When in response to the supervisor asking me if I was satisfied, I said, \\\"No, it was my understanding that Clark would be apologizing personally,\\\" the supervisor tried to tell me that because he was the boss, I could be assured that Clark wouldn't do these things anymore. I again reiterated that this is not what I was told would happen.

      "I think im done with Ghost Bar. This use to be my chill spot to take out of town visitors to impress them with the view, atmosphere and the mild party vibe. This last Friday i made list arrangements with a NEW promoter with the N9NE Group which i think is what F'ed me. My regular girl has been MIA for a while and so i needed to act fast and find somebody so i settled for this. Just myself with 3 girls on the list should not have been a problem. Had to do something new this time and check in at LA Tan in the palms (that was weird #1) as i never did this and was given a ticket that looked like i was going to see Shrek at the movies. Did the usual and got to the rope to find the Clipboard Master to drop a name and was told that these dumb ass tickets i got from La Tan still made me wait in line (weird #2) as why make previous arrangements to stand in line? So since im anti Disneyland lines i gave security a $50 shake and got passed that hurdle. Then when i got to the register... guess what i had to pay $25 to get in (weird #3). Im sorry but this has never happened in the past when dealing with the promoters ahead of time and making sure i kept their guy girl ratios in mind and favorable toward the girls obviously. So $75 bucks later im in Ghost Bar...and a little annoyed. \\nFirst round of drinks i worked toward the outside bar to the left only to find out that they dont have Seagram's 7 for my 7&7... say WUT! Really? Your gonna charge me $15 for a drink and you cant even carry the basic essentials behind your bar... fine ill take a Maker's Mark and coke which was made horribly as i like to enjoy my drinks and this was WAY too strong. The second round was bought at the main bar where they had everything and made alright but the wait was retarded, as it would be way more efficient if they stocked the outdoor bars properly. \\nBeside the negatives Ghost Bar still obviously remains to be a great view of the city with a decent DJ at times and an overall decent feel. But could be improved upon quite a bit to make the place worth spending the $15/ drink prices a more enjoyable experience. This was my last run to Ghost Bar since the issues at the door were slightly embarrassing and honestly ridiculous, i dont know if i have N9NE Group to thank for that or the actual bar/club but either way ill spend my money elsewhere where the service is more appreciative. I think Ghost Bar needs to take a step back and improve upon a few things but doubtful that will happen.\n",

A particular chubby, hairy, sales girl walked right by me, and went to help a caucasian couple.  They made her pull out all kinds of handbags but they ended up buying NOTHING HA !!  Then sweetheart Alejandro came out and showed me a few handbags that I liked.  I was pleased with his service. I just wish that this Louis Vuitton store had more Alma MM handbags...\n",

We ordered drinks from the bar, ridiculously priced for a restaurant during the day, $9.50 for some mojitos? Come on. They weren't that good. \\nNow we were starving when we arrived, I ordered the tilapia and asparagus and he order the meatloaf and potatoes. \\nWe received our food and he dug in right away. I just sat and looked at mine. \\n\\n\\\"Fourteen dollars for this? How much was yours, eleven dollars?\\\" \\nMy boyfriend looks at my plate and could only say, \\\"That's it?\\\" \\n\\nHe received a FULL plate of meatloaf and the other half of mashed potatoes. I had six stalks of asparagus and a piece of fish the size of a child's hand. That was it. \\n\\nI called the waiter over and asked him if all the fish were this size and he said he thought so and there was nothing wrong with my meal. I asked him if this was worth $14 to him and he said he thought so. I told him, \\\"I'm not from Scottsdale, I would like to see the manager.\\\" \\n\\nThe manager walks over and proceeds to actually argue with me about the food saying that it is perfectly fine. I said, \\\"It may be fine, it may taste great, but I'm still going to be hungry after this $14 meal. I would at least like another piece of fish.\\\" \\nHe tells me for $6 he could get me one more piece of fish and I tell him I'm not paying that for another piece this size. \\n\\nAt this point my boyfriend is offering me his food, but that's not what I wanted. \\n\\nFinally I tell the manager just take it back, I'm sorry to see you toss that but you are doing nothing to satisfy this customer. He literally did nothing but argue with me. \\n\\nI wasn't trying to get a free meal, I just wanted to get what I was paying for. \\n\\nRude people, overpriced food, crappy bar. \\nTake your business somewhere else.\n",

It's an odor one finds in a Mexican restaurant that uses it's oil way too long and has other kitchen issues. The decor is bizarre for a Mexican place and the menu is trying too hard to impress. When I saw the runny plastic goo called chile con queso come out that several had ordered and smelled the stale chips, I actually faked a phone call to get out of there. I had my own car and headed to a bar I know downtown that has never let me down. \\n\\nThe next day I polled my compadres about dinner and impressions ranged from \\\"just ok\\\" to \\\"awful\\\".

Reviews here, to sum up, seemed to be pretty mixed, with one's experience tied pretty closely to ordering the right things on the menu.  Armed with knowledge gleaned from other reviews, the lady and I rolled over there on a Friday night at 7:00pm.\\n\\nThe parking lot was a ghost town.  There were two tables being served.  Not a good sign, but hey, let's give it a shot.\\n\\nWe were immediately greeted by a friendly young guy who took us to a table of our choosing.  We were also immediately greeted by a NASTY smell in the air.  It smelled like someone dropped a deuce under a table.  Five days earlier.  This eau de outhouse permeated the entire restaurant.  I'm not the kind of guy who is up for making a big deal out of things.  I was fully prepared to try and ignore it and have some dinner.  The lady?  Not so much.\\n\\n\\\"Ummmm.... excuse me.  Do you smell that?\\\"\\n\\nOur host/server sheepishly replied, \\\"Haha... yeah, I guess I'm just kind of used to it.  It comes and goes around here.  It's the whole area.\\\"\\n\\nNow, I'm not a huge fan of the East Side in general, but come on.  The parking lot smelled fresh as a daisy by comparison.  There is clearly something horribly wrong with this building, and I hope that the young owners of Nosh and Swig have an attorney to help them get out of whatever ugly lease they are tied up in.  \\n\\nAfter he said he'd be back to take our drink orders, we held our breath, and made a beeline for the front door.\\n\\nI feel awful for them - and I hope they can get into another location.  One that doesn't smell like the parking garage of the Four Queens.  Two tables at prime time on a Friday night?  How many more Fridays can they possibly have in that space?\n",

      "I think this restaurant was the first one I bookmarked for our trip to Vegas. Huge portions, crazy menu, sold. The fact that we didn't have to travel off the strip to eat at it, was even better.\\n\\nWe made the epic trip down the strip to find this location. There seemed to be a huge lineup of people waiting for tables but we were told around 40 minutes for a table of 4. You're given your little buzzer (that doesn't work down on the casino floor) and then you wait. They both scream out your name and collect your buzzer, and if you're not there when they do so, off the list you go. Our wait was around that time but when it's 2pm and this is your breakfast, that time seems like an eternity.\\n\\nService was quite sparse, though our waiter was very nice. We placed our order for drinks and two came out right away, and the other two (bar beverages) took about 15 minutes. 15 minutes for a bottled beer and a margarita. Then we waited for our food and it must have taken close to an hour. The menu says that it make take a little while but after the wait for the table, this was a lot.\\n\\nI got a burger, stuffed with mushrooms and cheese, and a side salad. The burgers are huge and very messy to eat. Have lots of napkins! The meat isn't seasoned and so really it's just a very big average burger. The dressing on the salad was delicious and I think that was my favorite part of the meal.\\n\\nThe other meals at the table were fine but nothing was seasoned very well and it was all kinda meh. Portions are unnecessarily huge and they'll gladly box your leftovers up for you. Again, it took a long time for the bill to come and so by the time we left, it was after 4pm.\\n\\nIf you want to feed a family of 4 with one plate of food, this is your place. Prices are very reasonable but try to hit them at a slow time and be prepared to wait a long time for your food.\n",

It's affordable and the food is pretty good overall ...and some dishes are surprisingly good. To start the so called lentil soup that comes with every entree is a lot more than the name implies. It's a mixed veggie, curry, split peas etc etc soup, perfect for a chilly night. The shrimp Madras is very good - when they asked 1 to 5 how hot I said 6!! .. and they still had to bring me more hot sauce, typical of Charlotte. \\n\\nBut now the humble Chana (Chickpeas) Spinach Masala w/pomegranate, cardemon and spices is absolutely fragrant, spicy and  delicious. This dish could be served in a fine restaurant.\\n\\nAnother surprise: I usually don't go crazy for Asian deserts but we shared a pudding of carrots, raisins, cashews, rice sugar and cream ( Halwah? ) that manage to taste very unusual, yet familiar and delish as well. \\n\\nAn Indian couple seem to own and run this place, the wife is the cook and she really aims to please. She came out to our table 3 times to talk to us although there were a fair amount of customers - mostly Indians. We had dinner there twice and I think this lady does her best with the vegetarian dishes. I tend to be a meat eater myself but I'll stick to their vegetarian menu in the future\\n\\nThey also have a decent wine selection for $5 a glass which doesn't hurt the dining experience.\n",

      "Yes, just about every free-standing bar (meaning one that's not part of a hotel or something) tries to claim sports-bar status by littering their walls with big-screen TV's and tuning each to some different game. Well . . . see . . . anyone can do that, which is why it's popular. To make a REAL sports bar you need a management who develops sports as the raison d'etre of the place itself. And yes, I just used a fancy French phrase to philosophize about a sports bar.\\n\\nHazelwood's not only has large TV's on almost every vertical surface, they have TV's at every booth, just like truck stops in the old days had mini-jukeboxes. \\n\\nHazelwood's has good bar-fare at good prices on their menu, but also impressive specials that are only in effect during games. One of their beer specials when I visited was Widmer Hefeweizen. How often do you see that on special in other places?\\n\\nHazelwoods's not only welcomes local amateur sports teams, they sponsor a few, like the local rugby guys.\\n\\nHazelwoods will not only call you a cab if you over-imbibe, they also will shuttle you home in their own shuttle craft for free within a reasonable distance. This is putting their money within reasonable distance of their mouth, if you ask me.\\n\\nBut what is most important--and is most likely a result of the policies and features above--is the customer base. When I go into a sports bar and sit at the bar I want the guys next to me--strangers who just happen to be sitting there--to occasionally lean over and say in breathless excitement while staring me in the eye \\\"THE DIFFERENCE IN TIME OF POSSESSION IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE GAME WAS LESS THAN 5 MINUTES BETWEEN NEW YORK AND INDY!\\\" Seriously, this is important to me because just as people in a dancing bar should be fully involved with dancing, people in a sports bar should be fully involved with sports. And I find such running commentary helpful because I basically don't know shit about football.\\n\\nAlso, on the night I was there the rugby players were entertaining the whole bar with their profane gang-sings about necrophilia and such. This further contributed to the integrity of the impression. This is a sports bar full of sporty people.\\n\\nSo yes, Hazelwood's is a success and deservedly so. This is a SPORTS BAR. It's not an Applebee's, nor is it a dive with a lot of TV's. If you enjoy the spirit of the rabid spectator and can share the excitement of those who thrill to vicarious participation, you should go to this place.\n",

I have a lot of tolerance. 2 stars is because it was below Applebees in quality, service, price and ambiance.\\n\\nIf you've been to Craft you will notice that there are 3 tables that are situated in the hallway of the casino.

This tells me that the situation happens so often with disappointment in these tables, that the policy is free drinks automatically. So our ambiance was half hallway in front of the bathrooms.\\n\\nWe didn't cheap out. We got a mix of steaks from the high end black label wagyu to the $50 steaks on the menu. We also got 4 side dishes. The Kale was way too salty. We barely touched the side dishes. The ladies in our group got the Filet Mignon, men got Ribeye and Black label Wagyu. The ribeye wasn't any better than store bought and home grilled. The Wagyu was good. The Filet Mignon was intolerable! Bland, needing salt, dry, and tasting like ground beef.\\n\\nTom Colicchio should be ashamed. We were drilling the waitstaff on Tom Colicchio's visits to the restaurant and we found out he had only been there one time in the last year because a chef was promoted.

Secondly, what freakingly amazing tacos!! The cochinita pibil is one of my ultimate faves, with the carne asada very close to a tie!! Thirdly, the cocktails!! Oh my! The muy buena Paloma Cocktail!!! \\nBut seriously, this place is great, I cannot emphasize enough how terrific this cafe is.\\nI really adore and admire Gallo's style and taste in food, it's truly amazing, and closer to the actual modern food in Mexico, at least very similar to the South Central style.\\n You won't see the overplayed cheese and beans plate here, no sir!  That's what makes me love them more, how they steer more into the actual True Mexican dishes, with a bit of a slight twist but still about the same in extraordinary flavors.\n",

      "The food here was amazing, went for a lunch on a Friday and had a tuna bagel sandwich and some hummus with onion and pine nut. I also had a lemonade/mint smoothie/iced thing that was refreshing and different. My wife had a delicious panini with mushrooms that was even better than mine. So the food was great, why the three star review you say? \\n\\nHere's why I give Panini cafe two stars: I have never felt so uncomfortable in a casual restaurant before. Our server seemed annoyed that we didn't know what we wanted right away. There is also a language barrier with the staff that no one else in the cafe seemed to have a problem with because we were the only non-Israeli or European customers there. \\n\\nThe service level went down from there. Our food was slow to come out which is amazing to me because when we arrived, there were only two other tables occupied and we ordered sandwiches!\\n\\nFinally, while we were there two or three large parties showed up and we were kind of forgotten about. I had to ask twice to get our food boxed up and settle our bill.\n",

      "It's not that I wouldn't tell people to go here but this is what I would tell you. 1. Do not ever go here with a pregnant woman. We went here for our anniversary and I am 6 months pregnant. They sat us first in a tiny little booth, my belly was already touching the table and I began to get claustrophobic. I have never seen a booth so small in my life. It is a total design error. Private booths yes, not tiny private booths in a cubby in the wall--so uncomfortable. We asked to be moved, which I really felt for a place where we were spending that much money should have probably noticed that I was pregnant and found me the best most comfortable seat in the house--instead they found us a table with torturously hard chairs. Then they told me the big surprise that this is a 2 hour dining experience--a 6 month pregnant woman cannot sit in hard chairs for two hours--again someone should have noticed this and offered a better seating. I tried to brave it, in between the painfully slow out lay of tiny courses--again not fit for a starving pregnant woman--for about 2 hours, finally after several trips to the bathroom just to get the feeling back in my legs my husband had to ask to be moved again to an obviously better spot next to us--an open, normal sized booth with a cushy seat. I liked our waiter, very friendly, and the chocolate fondue at the end of the endless fondue was to die for. I'd go back and specify that I want a normal sized booth and probably just get the cheese fondue and chocolate. The other entrees were okay, but bring me out my food not in a trickle feed. By the end we had spent 3 hours there, had to move twice and I was just exhausted by the end and we paid over $130 for the whole thing. I've been to nicer restaurants and paid as much for more caring service perhaps and amazing food. It was alright, but again there's just a lot to know about the melting pot before you decide to spend three hours there. If you're looking for a romantic time with just some light eating and conversation then that's what this place has to offer, but men before you bring your girl there make sure to request a normal booth, and maybe think about ordering a la carte if you don't want to wait hours for your 4-course meal to be done.\n",

      "If I were being totally honest, I would give this place a 2 star review BUT my dining companion thought her food was pretty good, so I bumped it up a star for her. I went here with a friend last night after the Yelp event at PBS. It was very close by and also close to my the place I'm moving into in a couple of weeks, so I thought it would be a nice opportunity to give it a try. We went in, had no wait (it was like 9 pm or so) and were seated in the tiny dining room. The menu had some interesting looking items on it (the drink menu looked good too, but being that I had been drinking all night at the Yelp event, I figured I didn't need to pay 9$ for a drink....). I asked the waitress what soup they had, and she said they didn't have soup that day (and in a tone that was like...'you idiot' I think because the soup says Saturday soup or something, but I figured if it was on the regular everyday menu and not a specials menu it was probably just a name for the soup....maybe it was stupid....I don't know). So I asked for my second choice, the chicken and dumplings....oh sorry, we're out of that. ohhhhhhk. So I asked what she would get and she went on and on about the prawns. I told her I wasn't into seafood, so what did she suggest that was not seafood and she replied \\\"Have you ever had prawns?!?!\\\" Really? Not the expected response from a waitress....I have had prawns, I do not like them or most any seafood and I do not want an inflated check for food that I do not want because your restaurant is out of everything else. She then suggested the salad with chicken in it, so I got that. My friend got the chicken sandwich. She said the sandwich was good...my salad was terrible. We both concurred it was one of the worst salads I have had. The dressing tasted like orange rinds and was super sweet and the chicken in it was very spicy (which I like) but the two flavors together were not complimentary. Also, the salad was drenched in that dressing....no eating around it. The veggies seemed fresh enough and it looked nice, but for 10$ it is absolutely not worth it. I got a to go box and left it by the light rail so a homeless person could try to eat it, although I think they may even leave it behind. I'm not sure I would come back here...hard to judge a restaurant off of one salad, but I'm leaning toward a no on that one. \\n\\nPS my friend said they have really cute bathrooms, so that's a plus!\n",

After hearing (and Yelp reading) a few reviews about it, I have formulated my very own take on the place:\\n\\nGORGEOUS! The views from this bar are amazing. Especially on the Lucky Strikes Bowling side. I drank my Redbull Vodka happily as I stared into the vast array of buildings at night. The seats/bar/layout are very modern and comfortable. The decor is posh. The lighting was not too dark, but not too bright. It was perfect! \\n\\nFUN- There is a bar, a dance floor, lounge, arcade and a bowling alley. I went with a few friends and had a blast. I could dance it up for a while, then stroll on over the lounge and relax. I am surprised that so many are not raving about this place! \\n\\nENVIRONMENT- I enjoyed the environment here. The people were very relaxed, not too dressed up but not too dressed down ect. There was not the \\\"I'm here to get laid\\\" vibe which was amazing! Everyone seemed very chill and there genuinely to enjoy a night out.\\n\\nSTAFF- The staff was very professional and sweet. They were not overly pretentious or rude which is rare for the nicer bars. The drinks were priced about the same price as they are on Mill Ave, however they are bigger and not served a plastic dixie cup (lol).\\n\\nOverall, I LOVED this place!

      "Perhaps it's Superbowl weekend that made Boa seem sub par, or maybe it was the fact that you can only get happy hour prices at the bar, or even the way the bartender was more concerned about setting the Tivo to record some T.V. show, instead of serving us our last happy hour drink, I just don't know. Either way I am not impressed at all with Cafe Boa. For one, the entire restaurant  was reserved until 9:30pm, Ok, so let's sit outside you say. Ahhh but low and behold you cannot get happy hour prices outside. Would this be so bad if the bar wasn't 10 ft by 10ft....probably not. So the happy hour \\\"area\\\" is small but luckily we were able to find a seat at the bar. Now the prices are good, and they offer a decent amount of drink specials on everything from wine to beer, to martinis, however the food is limited. I though the Pinot Noir I ordered (half off) was very dry for a Pinot. The food specials and sausage dish served in a marinara sauce was ok, the sauce was interesting with capers and black olives. It did give me some new ideas to experiment with, when I make my sauce.  Unfortunately the sausage was dry like the Pinot. (good pairing) My date ordered a cappretta salad, which was several tomatoes and some mozzarella and this cool soft cheese. Or \\\"badass\\\" as our bartender described it. LOL!  That was very good, but it was an extremely small portion.  Overall the service was decent. I heard the energetic, charismatic bartender, drop several F bombs, and the staff seemed somewhat \\\"wired\\\" like someone left a big basket of easter candy in the back, and they all got into it. Sugar rushes aside, overall the final bill tallied up to 30$ (without tip) for 4 glasses of wine, and 2 apps. Not bad you say? Since we missed one happy hour drink, the bartender was cool enough to leave one of our drinks off the tab, to balance it out. As he said \\\"It was both our faults we missed that deadline\\\" with a smile. I jokingly replied, \\\"actually I just blame you.\\\" I was kidding, but also somewhat serious as he spent about 10 minutes trying to figure out the Tivo settings. Um, who has TIvo in a bar anyway?\n",

It comes with Chicken, vegetables, edamame, potstickers and a drink. \\n\\nChicken was  dry, it was expected.  I think many people have commented same about chicken being little dry.  It is cooked on charbroiler. So expect the little dryness.  \\n\\nSpicy tuna roll was fresh and enjoyable. I think they just made it when i ordered it. So make sure to ask when it was made before ordering.  Because it is already made and stored inside the container.\\n\\nService was good. Owner was friendly and attentive. \\n\\nFor the money. This place is a great for quick lunch. I would revisit again if I am in the area.  However, I wouldn't make an effort to drive the distance just to eat.\n",

I had called when I initially bought my Groupon but was told that it would be about 2 months before I could get in so I decided to wait and see what my schedule was for the fall.  I just called back today to set up an appointment and lo and behold, the girl told me that my Groupon had already been used...back when I initially called but didn't schedule anything.  There is nothing they can do about it apparently and now I have to take it up with Groupon.  What a joke!  I should have read the reviews before I bought the Groupon.\n",

      "So I have driven by this place a million times thinking \\\"I gotta get there sometime\\\".  The consensus that I've heard was that the place was fantastic and had great wine.  We had a Groupon $20 for $45 which is always featured so I recommend that because why wouldn't you if its there and your going to dine there anyway.\\n\\nImmediately when you walk in your eyes are drawn the candles that are lit everywhere and directly in front of you is the redish orange unique chandallier.  Pretty neat.  Ambiance just punched you in the face. I had been here before this became Mezzos and don't remember the details as much as I did this time.  The ceiling is dropped down creating a circled effect which I thought added a lot of character to the place.  To your right is a little sectioned off party room/section that would be good for a large party.  To the left is the bar area which I really didn't get to check out closely being that we were seated on the other side closer to the kitchen.  \\n\\nThe server and guy assisting him were fabulous, attentive and very nice.  I believe the owner was there, however he never greeted us. \\n\\nI ordered my glass of Chardonnay and they didn't have my first choice.  Soo I ordered my second choice.  It wasn't too shabby but $10 a glass.  I hate the mark up on wine sometimes. The BF was disappointed they didn't have mixed drinks so he just ordered a soda.  \\n\\nThe bread came out right away.  Reminded me of some bread that I make at home.  Crusty on the outside and doughy on the inside....warm and delightful.  It accompanied a small bowl of oil and balsalmic.  Too much oil for my taste.  I kinda like more of the balsalmic but it was still really good.  We ordered the Caesars salad to share and it was perrrfect.\\n\\nFor my entree I ordered the penne ala vodka with chicken as an add-on.  It came out and looked amazing.  There was way too much chicken though - SAID NO ONE EVER - except for ME!  Sorry.  I like more noodles and a hint of chicken.  There was a lot of chicken and a lot of sauce.  All was tasty to say the least and 1/2 went home for leftovers.  BF ordered the chicken parm with a side of penne with marinara.  This was ALOT of chicken too but he wasn't complaining.  It almost felt like 3 portions...no kidding.  Needless to say we brought some of that home as well.\\n\\nOverall a great experience.  Ambiance is a 5.  It has outdoor seating that would be amazing to enjoy if it wasn't over 100 degrees outside right now.  I think with our Groupon we only spent $15 over that.  Nice little date night and a definite need to go back and bring friends!  \\n\\nBTW- the leftovers were BOMBdiggity the day after.  Better than the meal itself.  Big fan.\n",

She was kind enough to take my steak back to the kitchen. Michael, our server, finally shows up 10 minutes later with a half-hearted apology and to let me know that my steak was being prepared again. He does not offer to refill our drink glasses that have now been sitting empty for 20 minutes. The manager makes an appearance and brings me a strip steak that looks rare from the sight of it. He informs me that my steak is on him and apologizes. He goes away. I cut into my steak and it's, you guessed it, Pittsburgh Rare. I asked for medium rare. He returns and I tell him that the chef needs to go back to culinary school and learn how to prepare a steak. The manager apologizes again and asks me if I want to take this pathetic piece of beef home with me! Not only is it rare but it's a cheap cut of strip steak that is loaded with connective gristle. I said no thanks. He comped my husband's meal and we left. I never hope for people to lose their jobs but the cook and the server really need some serious retraining!

The style is what I would call East Texas Church Picnic; the meats are all overcooked and the sauce is way too thick and sickeningly sweet. OK, their sauce does really suck. The potato salad was bland and insipid as well.\\n\\nBrisket is the King, Here the king is undersmoked and over trimmed. Brisket for a Brave New World, or sadly just for the 21st century? I watched the video on their website and it appears they use modern digitally controlled ovens instead of traditional pits.

That doesn't make me the biggest spender in the world, but it's a good chunk of change to spend in a mid-level men's formal wear shop.  And it's not peanuts to me, so when I come in looking to spend that money,  I expect a little attention from the staff and some advice.  They're really not good at attention or advice at this Men's Wearhouse l,ocation.  That hasn't been my experience at all of their stores, but this one is particularly bad.\\n\\nI stopped in 2 different times to look at buying a few suits.  The first time I stopped in, no one greeted me or asked if I needed help.  But to be fair, the staff looked like they were helping a fair amount of customers looking to rent tuxedos.  So I figured I'd just come back when they weren't so busy.\\n\\nThe next time I came in, a woman offered to help me.  We talked about what I wanted (classic gray business suit) and she took me over to the section of suits in my size.  After a minute of looking, she just told me, \\\"Looks like we don't have one in\\\" and walked off.  The store wasn't that busy.  She walked back to the register and talked with other staff.  No alternatives offered, no advice.  So I poked around for about 5 more minutes and split.  \\n\\nI headed over to a different Men's Wearhouse, where they met me at the door and discovered they didn't have the exact suit I wanted after talking to me.

      "New Year's Eve major malfunction!!  I went to Phoenix to spend the holiday weekend with a friend. I checked in, the staff was very courteous, the room was nice and big, although in need of some updating. Well, everything was fine until we returned from the New Year's festivities. We arrived about 1:30 am, and my key didn't work. I went to the lobby, soon to discover that EVERYONE'S key did not work!! As you can imagine, we were all a little upset. The guy behind the counter was very nice, but could not offer anyone a acceptable reason. About an hour later, we were told that we would be put up for the night in the hotel next door at no cost. That was ok for me, as I didn't need any of my belongings that night. Some people had medications in their rooms, and one lady even had her dog locked in the room, there was also a group who went to the jacuzzi and were stranded without a change of dry clothes!!!! We went to the other hotel, and were taken care of, and finally got to bed about 4am. Went back the following day, they still were having problems with the locks, an hour later everything was fixed. Also the TV only got 3 channels and the shower had no pressure. I'm going to think twice before I stay here again.\n",

      "Delicious food with incredibly slow service. The other reviews were so good, I hope we were just there on an off night. It was a Saturday, for what it's worth.\\n\\nSo, yes, the food was pretty darn good. I might even give it five stars if I had received what I actually wanted to eat (more on that later). Deliciously smoky beef, tender chicken, al dente pasta in saffron sauce, perfectly cooked buttery rice, lightly crispy french fries. (French fries? Yeah, I wasn't expecting that either, but it works.) \\n\\nHowever. The service was about as bad as it gets without being actually rude. Five minutes to be even acknowledged, 10 to get water, another 10 to order, 30 waiting for food.... But slow was not even the worst of it.\\n\\nAfter that 30 minute wait, my husband's meal arrived, but there was no word on mine. A few minutes later, my food could be seen sitting on the counter ignored by the waiter - as it turns out, because it was beef instead of the chicken I had ordered. When he figured that out, he brought the dish saying he could serve me this one or have the kitchen make what I had ordered. Picturing another 1/2 hour wait, I took the beef. It was, of course, luke warm. And rare. Which, sure, lots of people eat, but not my thing. \\n\\nFor the mix-up, we got a sincere apology and a free dessert. However, at no time did the waiter ever acknowledge or apologize for the extremely slow service throughout, leading me to conclude that it is the norm at Surco.

      "FAMOUS FOR:\\n- Steaks\\n\\nBUZZ\\n- Prime Rib\\n\\nI TRIED\\n- French Onion Soup (7/10)\\n- Bone In Rib Eye (2/10)\\n- Sauteed Mushrooms (5/10)\\n\\nI was once on a flight and saw that someone had left a Robb Report magazine in seat back pocket. I flipped through it and saw it had listed the 7 best steakhouses in Vegas, and I was astonished when it even mentioned Circus Circus. I mean, what is actually redeemable from that decrepit place? I read on to find out it actually won some kind of award saying it's the best steakhouse in all of Vegas. Wait... WHAT? Come again? Circus Circus...THE Circus Circus? The Circus Circus that's way off the strip, and has thousands of smelly kids (and adults) swarming and mobbing all over the lobby, the taxi lines, and hallways? THAT Circus Circus has the best steak? No F-ing Way! For a few years, I've been wanting to go, but probably in the 5 times I've been to Vegas since reading that article, nobody wanted to go. This time, I finally got the chance!\\n\\nThe menu is very simple. They have quite a few seafood options like crab legs, oysters, lobster tail, etc., but at a place called \\\"The Steakhouse,\\\" I feel like those are sort of obligatory menu items. No idea how they taste. Pretty much the menu is STEAK, and very few appetizer and side offerings. Asparagus? No. Creamed spinach or corn? Nope. Mac & Cheese? Psh! As if! They got seafood accompaniments and sauteed mushrooms. Period. So...pretty limited choices.\\n\\nAll the steaks I've had in Vegas have been decent, but not all that great. I'd prefer Morton's to SW, Carenvino, Delmonico, Cut, GR Steak, and I'm sure I'm missing a couple others. I was actually hoping Circus Circus wasn't good, because if it was good, that means we may need to make trips out this way to have steak from now on. Well..\\n\\nFRENCH ONION SOUP\\nNot my normal appetizer, but considering the limited choices, the only one that made sense. It was pretty decent. Presentation was kinda cool, bowl served on a plate with some extra croutons and cheese shreds in cute little heaps. Seasoned well, onions were cooked well. It was probably what I'd call textbook French Onion Soup. It was good, but nothing really made it unique or special. It was just good French Onion Soup.\\n\\nRIBEYE\\nHere goes. It's presented ok. The cost of the steak comes with your choice of potato. The steak looked healthy - decent spots of char all over. I start cutting a piece, and ended up finding that about 30% of my piece was fat. The fat is the most seasoned part of the steak, and also pretty delicious. Normally I cut it off, but hey, Vegas! It's the most seasoned part of the steak, so this bite should have been stellar...but...no. In fact, there was hardly any seasoning at all!\\n\\nYou couldn't even fathom my disappointment! If there was any kind of special mesquite flavoring, I didn't find it. The meat was decently tender, and I can't really complain about any of its technical aspects (i.e. medium rare was just as I asked), but the taste was just so BORING! Nothing inspiring, nothing savory, nothing...good! It was bad! I mean, there was nothing going on with this! It's not like \\\"no news is good news.\\\" With steak, \\\"no news is the worst possible news!\\\" I had to restrain myself from asking for A1, but I did end up sprinkling some salt on it. It did make it taste better but anytime you add salt after the fact, it doesn't taste right. I was so disappointed I probably left 1/3 of it. I was taking scoops of mashed potatoes with each steak bite, to try to add seasoning somehow. I tried everything. Nothing worked. It just gave up!\\n\\nIt was a pretty bad steak...not the worst I've ever had, but definitely the worst $50 steak I've ever had. \\n\\nMUSHROOMS\\nWell, certainly better than the steak, and while tasting halfway decent, it wasn't anything special. If I went to TGI Friday's or Outback or Chili's and got this batch of sauteed mushrooms, I'd have found it fitting, but if I paid $7 for them (and it was a pretty small batch), I'd like something with a little more creativity! \\n\\nINDIANA JONES & THE STEAKHOUSE OF DOOM\\nI was really, really upset! I mean, even though it was free (company paid), which should make it taste even better, I couldn't believe what a waste of money this place was. Considering the $20-$30 roundtrip cab ride and having to swim through a roaring (and smelly) sea of children and parents for about a mile (exaggerating), there's more at \\\"steak\\\" here (see what I did there?). \\n\\nEither A) the reviewers were all full of sh*t, or B) We got the C- cooks, because I can't imagine how an establishment like this could have gotten high marks anywhere. \\n\\nThankfully, I now know, I don't EVER have to go to Circus Circus again! If you're a curious person like me, then you probably do need to go here, just to say that you've tried it and conquered it. Otherwise, if you're solely on a mission to try actually good food.

Wait until you hear my story...\\n\\nOk, so before I got to AZ, my husband had Rob @ I Clean Carpets come to totally clean our carpets and tile.  I am allergic to cats and the previous owners had several, so I was worried about that...well Rob did a fantastic job bringing our carpet and tile back to life, sans allergens!!  He worked SO hard and stayed here until LATE at night to get the job done.  My husband was really impressed!\\n\\nFast forward 2 weeks...I move in, (NO allergies from prev. cats!)  We have a sudden water leak from the water line in the bathroom while I am out...total flood in CARPETED bathroom!  UGH!  The plumber recommended I call a restoration company or rent a Shop Vac from Home Depot.  INSTEAD, I called Rob @ I Clean Carpets...\\n\\nBest Decision!!!  He came right out (even though he was booked!!), pulled up the carpeting, disinfected, deodorized, set up a industrial fan to dry the carpet and padding and said he would return later in the day to check on it.\\n\\nHe returned as he said, reattached the carpet and put everything back!  THEN, he repaired areas of the carpet where the previous kitties had shredded @ doorways.  He actually cut out puzzle pieces of extra carpeting to fill in areas that looked shredded.  The repairs look great!!\\n\\nRob just goes above and beyond what is expected!!!  Prices are more than fair and get this...he is a YELPer too!!  Can't be beat!\\n\\nThanks Rob!! :)\n",

      "I didn't think this place was that great, but probably because I have such great Greek places in San Diego that I'm used to so that I wasn't impressed with this place. The food was pretty expensive for what you get but I guess that's what you would expect from a mall food court. I got the Mediterranean chicken salad without the raisins (ew yuck raisins in salad) and didn't really think much of it. It wasn't really that flavorful so I guess the dressing could do some work. The salad was really big though and I couldn't finish it all. It had tomatoes, onions, corn, parsley, cheese, and chicken. I really think that the salad could do without the parsley and would probably taste a lot better with cilantro, but that may just be my bias love of cilantro :P. Since the flavor wasn't doing much for me I got some of the hot sauce they had and mixed it in with the salad and after that then it actually tasted a lot better. Even after the hot sauce I wasn't able to finish the salad so I brought it home to eat later. Usually I don't think it's a good idea to bring home salad because it usually gets all soggy and gross, but for some reason this salad was oh kay when I ate it later that night. I actually thought it was better when I ate it later that night for some reason. Maybe the salad absorbed more of the dressing? Or maybe because there was less parsley in it? But either way, I finished it later that night and it did taste better. Overall though if I had to chose a place to eat I wouldn't chose this place again.\n",

      "Went here yesterday for lunch. Pretty busy little place at lunch time with the downtown business crowd.  Anyhow, there food is solid but overpriced. Nothing exceptional but nothing bad that I have had either. I had the salmon burger yesterday. The shoestring french fries were good, I am pretty sure they are fresh and that was probably my favorite part.  The salmon burger itself, which was recommended by the waitress, was extremely dry. I was hesitant to try it as they stated it was not a piece of salmon . I surmised it was salmon flakes with filler aka what I would expect from the frozen section at any grocery store. So going back to the dry salmon patty, the salmon burger had cream cheese - which again I am not a big fan of but I think the cream cheese and the copious amounts of mayonnaise helped offset the dryness of the salmon patty.  The menu stated that the salmon burger had a balsamic aioli, however I could not taste that at all on the burger and there did not appear to be any balsamic dressing on the burger.  I did like the bread and butter chips on top of the burger (there were five held on top with a toothpick).  My total for the salmon burger & fries, with no drink including a $2 tip was $15. I just don't see going back for the price that they charge. \\n\\nI overhead another waiter saying that the hangover burger was great, and my friend who got the hangover burger liked it but I just can't justify paying $13 for a burger unless I was at BURGR or the like.  If I am going to get a hamburger and it's not high end then I am an In-N-Out girl because, hey, that's what a hamburger's all about... but I digress. \\n\\nI went to MTO once before, about six months ago, and remember getting the salmon wrap. Again I remember it being okay but nothing really noteworthy. I split it with a friend and it is definitely not big enough for splitting. \\n\\nAs a side note, they serve beer for $5, there were some good choices Dogfish Head 60 - although they also had PBR, I question who would really pay $5 for PBR - although a friend pointed out he noted a resurgence of \\\"cheap\\\" beer as being trendy - I haven't noticed that but I pay more attention to micro brews and wine myself.  But MTO seems to attempt to appeal to a sense of nostalgia by referencing wonder bread and Velveeta amongst other items, so maybe that is their justification for $5 for PBR? Anyway, long story short - okay to try but don't get the salmon burger unless you are in the mood for a patty that has the moisture of the Sahara desert and expect to pay a premium for pretty much anything.\n",

I felt like they were trying too hard to be cute and trendy, rather than focusing the flavor and providing a balanced meal.  Also while I understand that a true improvisational cuisine is hard to accomplish with a restaurant that size,  it was pretty clear they had a set menu for the night and just rotated it between the tables. For example, I noted in my restrictions \\\"Vegetarian, eat dairy LOVE cheese\\\".  I was served no dairy what so ever.  By my third course I complained because so far my food had been mediocre, and round 3 tasted like a stew, everything was cooked in the same broth.  Not to mention I couldn't cut through the asparagus with my knife or my teeth! \\n\\nThe server was great, when I complained she had them make me a new course, parmesan risotto. It was better, but not creative and definitely didn't have a \\\"wow\\\" factor.    She also brought us out a nice cheese plate on the house, which was by far the best part of the meal.

This particular one has a drive-thru, which is awesome, except everyone else thinks so too!  The line of cars was too long for my impatiences, so I decided to park and make a quick run inside.  Let me reiterate my need for quickness, as in swoop inside, place my order, get my coffee and split like an overripe banana. Of course when your in a hurry, no one else is.  So was my fate today at Starbucks.\\n\\nI've always had terrific and timely service at this Starbucks' drive-thru.  The person taking my order is always chipper and pleasant, and when I pull around to pick up my beloved cafe mocha, I'm always greeted with a smile and a lovely \\\"have a nice day.\\\" \\n\\nNot so when I entered the sanctimonious inner-chamber of Starbucks! No one to welcome me at the counter; baristas working here and there completely ignoring me; and me standing there trying to grab their attention with my awkward and annoyed demeanor.  Finally, a barista  glanced over and said something that was barely audible.  A minute later, he finally noticed me and said curtly, \\\"Wadda ya having?\\\"  \\n\\n\\\"Uh... a tall cafe mocha and, and, um, do you have blueberry muffins?\\\" \\n\\n\\\"Aren't there any over there?\\\" he pounced. \\n\\nI responded timidly, \\\"Oh, I guess so, I didn't look.\\\" \\n\\nHe grabs a muffin and my drink and sets it on the counter.  \\n\\nAnother barista, a surly old dude from the East Coast, pops by and says, \\\"Wadda get?\\\" I told him, gave him my credit card, he processes it, hands it back and moves on to the next person.

It does have a kick, but to say these are amazing? No way. I was feeling pretty hungry so I went with the \\\"Cheeseburger\\\" (two patties) and I just can't say it's that good. I think it may be the way they wrap the damn thing up so tight. It makes the burger become super soggy super fast. I just feel like I'm eating a mooshed up wanna-be burger. I'm sorry, I feel as though I shouldn't be bashing them this bad, but I'm just so disappointed.\\n\\nAnd overall the price just does not reflect these burgers. $11 is too much for a combo meal I don't care how many fries you over-fill my bag with.\n",

My husband was the one craving pizza, so I let him order a sausage, mushroom, and onion regular 16\\\" pie.  The pizza is New York style; thin, chewy crust.

And, I had a bite of my friends poblano cream chicken enchiladas -- the sauce was delicious but the chicken was bland. If you are looking for a good taco plate or enchilada with rice and beans...move along because the rest of the menu is bland-to-mediocre at very best. The last time I was there the beans were undercooked and the rice was flavorless. MOLE OR BUST! It might be the only thing worth coming for. \\n\\nSummary: The mole alone would get 5 stars but I realize it's not for everyone.

      "Let me just preface this review by saying, I really really didn't want to like Pizzeria Bianco because of all the hype I have heard about it. Unfortunately (or fortunately I suppose), I actually did like Pizzeria Bianco. While I cannot say it was the best pizza I have ever ate, it was good and I walked away a pleasantly full and happy gal.\\n\\nTo avoid having my opinion of Pizzeria Bianco swayed one way or the other by a potential 3 hour wait, and since I don't feel like any food is worthy of a 3 hour wait, I went with a group of 6 friends and made a reservation. My biggest advice if you are going to make a reservation, make it way before the date you want to go! It took three times calling for a reservation before I got one...last night the hostess shed some light on why...they only take one reservation for each time slot. If you do decide to go without a reservation, take advantage of drinks and apps beforehand at either Bar Bianco or Rose and Crown!\\n\\nPizzeria Bianco is small and tables are very close together, so if you don't like dining almost on top of the table next to you, I suggest skipping this place. Our waiter was friendly and provided good service most of the night. Coke comes in the old fashioned bottles and the alcohol selection is a bit small, but I guess the focus is really the food. Our group started with an order of the spiedini (fontina wrapped in prosciutto) and an order of the tomato and mozzarella as appetizers. Definitely if you are with a group, order at least two of the spiedini, as it only comes with two skewers which only affords each person a very small bite. The tomato and mozzarella fed our group easily, so one order for a group of 6 should be fine. The tomatoes were so fresh and juicy, and the mozzarella was super fresh as well...all and all, it was probably the best caprese I have had. Both appetizers were winners with our group. We also went through two plates of the bread and olive oil before our pizzas arrived...my only complaint was that I prefer when restaurants put a bit of seasoning in the olive oil to kick the flavor up a bit.\\n\\nWe ordered five pizzas...2 Biancoverdes, 1 Margherita, 1 Rosa, and 1 Sonny Boy. We probably should have just gone with four pizzas, but with five, we had leftovers for some people to take home. I really enjoyed the Biancoverde and the Margherita, although the Biancoverde was by far the heaviest of the pizzas and had intense flavors. It had a bit too much argula for my liking, but it was very good. The margherita was simple, yet tasted very fresh and had a good cheese to tomato ratio, which is very important in my book for a quality Margherita. The Rosa and Sonny Boy were hits with our group as well, although I think the Sonny Boy was probably the least favorite of the four kinds we ordered. For the two appetizers, five pizzas, a glass of wine, a coke, double expresso, and a cappucino, our bill came to $111...when we added in the tip, each person in our party of 6 paid $22. I thought that was incredibly reasonable and actually much less than I had been planning to spend.\\n\\nThere were a few negatives about my Pizzeria Bianco experience:\\n1. Parking - the lot for PB customers was full when I arrived at 5:30 pm, so I was directed to the garage on 5th Street which was fine. However, even after getting my ticket validated at PB, it still cost me $3 to park. Not a huge thing, but I think that people turned away from the lot (which is free) should be told that they will still have to pay to park at the garage, just at a discounted rate.\\n\\n2. When we arrived at 6:30 (time of our reservation), we had to wait for 15 minutes for a table. Granted, not a three hour wait, but it just irks me a bit when you have reservations for a specific time and then are still made to wait.\\n\\n3. The table of two guys next to us were asked to leave by the hostess...she told them they could finish their beers outside or next door, but they had to leave so a party of two could be seated at their table. I have never heard of something like that happening before. Our group was a bit shocked and as my friend said, \\\"I guess to be a hostess here you need to have quite a pair\\\". \\n\\n4. After we got our check, we waited over 15 minutes for someone to take it and bring the change (we paid in cash). Our waiter never actually came and got it...the hostess overheard us wondering when someone was going to come and get our money, so she picked it up and handled it for us. The funny thing was that there was a group waiting for our table outside! \\n\\nOverall, I would say Pizzeria Bianco is a 3.5 star establishment, but I'm giving it 4 stars (Yelp really needs half stars!) because the food exceeded my expectations in terms of quality and freshness, and our group walked away quite happy with our dining experience despite a few hiccups.\n",

      "I'll start this review by saying we've heard from friends that this Mexican restaurant was a great place to get a good margarita bigger then your head and some decent Mexican fare. As we're always looking to try out new restaurants, we thought this would become one of our new favs...and decided in the end that, sadly, it will not be on our list to revisit. \\n\\nNow, I will say I did not try the margarita (it was a \\\"school night,\\\" so-to-speak), so I can't vouch for how delicioso it is. What we did end up ordering was the guacamole, which underwhelmed, and both the enchiladas and the tacos were mediocre. The service was quite slow (not sure if that was due to a lack of sufficient staffing or the fact that our server was more interested in the telenovela then us). \\n\\nOverall, would say for a stellar Mexican restaurant experience, we'll head back to Cantina 1511. Prices are a bit higher, but food, drinks, and service are always fantastic.\\n\\nUPDATE: shortly after posting this I received a note from the manager asking for additional details and requesting that we give Three Amigos one more try. On that alone we will go back and see if our experience was just a fluke. Responding to my review that quickly makes me think that they ARE serious about customer service.

      "I called to see how much a synthetic oil change would be, the guy said $54. I walk in literally 10 minutes later and ask for the same thing and the girl says $59. I told her the guy I talked to said $54 and that I also had a $10 off coupon from the last oil change I got at another sears location. She said they had a deal and it would be better to go with their promotion. 1 hour later they call me and say I need a new air filter , tire rotation, and coolant flush and they were having a friends and family discount so it would only be $80 for all that. I passed on that offer. I go back to pay and end up paying $54 the original quote I got on the phone. My $10 off coupon went to waste and they only offered me the F & F discount if I got all that other unnecessary stuff done yet the lady before me got the F & F discount on her oil change!

      "Omigod, I don't know how we managed to miss this place in the 9 or so years we've been in Vegas!  I'd heard about it forever, but finally went after a performance of La Cage aux Folles at the Smith Center ran a lot longer than we expected.  It was late, we were very hungry, and I figured they'd be open.\\n\\nI was unprepared for all the neon.  But I LOVE neon, so this place had my kind of vibe.  It took a long time to slog through the big menu, but as we were looking I was also noticing the size of the portions passing by, so we decided to share an omelet, with hash browns and a toasted bagel.\\n\\nThe omelet was gargantuan, and when I asked our waitress how many eggs it had, she said \\\"about 10.\\\"  That meant four eggs for me, since I always make sure hubby has a bigger portion.  That's usually my quota for six months.  I've never been a big fan of home fries, but these were the bomb;  I just couldn't stop eating them.  My only nit was the bagel, which was barely toasted, but I think even more toasting couldn't have saved it.  You can't pass off this thing with a whole to a New Yorker and really get away with it.  It looked like a bagel, but didn't quack like one.\\n\\nWe didn't have drinks, but had a good time looking at the mammoth drink being shared at the table next to us.  Next time we will indulge, either in the restaurant, or in the lounge, which I made sure to check out before we left.  Spectacular!, and I can't wait to try it.\\n\\nThis all took place the night before I was to leave for Jersey for an extended period.  The next night, friends were arriving from the East Coast, and where did hubby take them?  You guessed righ.  And that couple liked it so much that all three of them went back the next night, too.   With all that food, I hope I'll recognize my husband by the time I get back!\\n\\nPeppermill is the closest thing to our beloved East Coast Greek diners, but in true Vegas style, glitzier, bigger, brighter, and over the top.  In a good way.\n",

There is a line at about 8 o clock at this place...which means if you don't get in early, your pretty much waste your night waiting in line.  Cover was a bit more than XS, i paid $45, and when I got in I was sort of disappointed.   They have 3 levels.  The top level is a loungy area with pool tables where you can hang out.  The middle level is the main level with a decent sized dance floor and a patio that opens outdoors to a small pool.  The bottom floor is the hip hop floor which I though was a little tight and hard to get around.  The ambiance and decor is nice, but I prefer XS cause I just felt more comfortable there.\n",

As they grew and became more popular in Vegas, however, it got worse and worse.\\n\\nClearwire throttles heavy users. They don't admit to doing it, but they do. Usually it only happens to me at night when their usage is heaviest. Today, it's been all day long. It is worse than dial-up. I work from home and I find this intolerable.\\n\\nI called Clearwire and they again repeated the lie that they don't throttle (even though you can find proof from other users posted all over the Internet). I ran a speed test and, check this out. They promise 4G service. My download speed is 2.09 Mbps, upload is .28. Yes. . .point two eight. As I type this there is at least a one second lag before each letter shows up.\\n\\nI am so over this. Yes, it's cheap. But if you depend on being able to work online, spend the extra money for a better service. I did a lot of research and am having CenturyLink installed tomorrow. Yes, they actually gave me a next-day appointment. I've read negatives about both Cox and CenturyLink, but nothing can be as bad as Clear so I'm not worried.\\n\\nIf all you do is check your email and do light Internet surfing, you may be fine.

The word I would use to describe the entire place is probably gaudy.  Walking into the place, the walls were pretty barren and the decorations looked like the inside of a Forever 21 dressing room, actually I'm pretty sure, the chandelier was the same one. Most of the people who worked there were very young and dressed like they were going out for the night, I guess given my previous experiences with salons / spas, were the workers were either dressed in uniforms / more conservatively covered, this was a bit unusual. \\n\\nThe quality of service was the worst service I've ever received for the amount that I paid. Maybe the range was typical for Scottsdale, but around Evanston, I can get a mani/pedi for $32 and receive better quality work, and at this place, I got a premium pedi / hot oil treatment mani for $53 combined not including tip. The color selection for the nail polishes were very limited and mostly, the colors were pretty loud and gaudy.

This is definitely a perfect place for a date or someone to impress, it's very serene and tranquil and was just a complete relaxation from the usual (but I'm probably saying this because I went right when they opened so it wasn't overly crowded with noise and chatter.) The service was excellent, they were friendly, professional and had immaculate timing with food, refills, etc. (probably because I was one of the few there at the time but still you'd be amazed at how many restaurants suck at this). I also really liked the bathrooms, they weren't the usual dingy bathroom, it kind of felt like a hotel bathroom. I know ... a bathroom review is weird but sometimes it's just good to know. \\n\\nI had the E-Haan Sausage, Calamari, Spinach Salad, Drunken Noodles and the Salmon Avocado Curry. The curry was recommended as the \\\"best dish ever in the city\\\" by the server and with that bold statement I knew it would fail to live up to expectations. It was good, not a standout but still good. The calamari was actually really good much to my surprise. It wasn't over breaded, had the perfect consistency and the sauce was spicy but sweet, a good complement. \\n\\nThe E-Haan Sausage was different, you wrapped it in a lettuce wrap and it had different toppings, original, good and different. The drunken Noodles tasted like...drunken noodles. Nothing outstanding, they tasted exactly what they were supposed to taste like. \\n\\nI was a little confused about the hype over the spinach salad. The lime dressing is actually amazing, I love lime and I could drizzle that stuff over anything but the actual salad is just fried lettuce or tempura battered lettuce. I have an inner fat kid so anything fried tastes good, I'm not a fan of carrots but guess what's good? Fried carrots. Almost anything fried can be good so I'm not sure why this dish is overhhyped.\\n\\nAll in all not a bad place to check out, good environment, good wine selection, but not five stars because the food was good, but I can't see myself ever craving it or telling someone they have to go here to try a specific dish.\n",

I've never been treated so disrespectful in my entire life. \\n\\nCame here last night with 3 friends after having dinner at Squid Ink since it's the only bar in the area.  Ordered a beer for myself and 2 of my friends and was promptly told that in order to get the drinks I would need to surrender my keys.  Ok... I told them and I gave them my keys even though I didn't even bring my car here.  My friends and I ordered shots, then went on the dance floor and goofed around having a good time.  When I went to order another drink I was told by the waitress that I was \\\"too drunk.\\\"  \\\"Excuse me?\\\" I asked her, \\\"I've had 2 drinks!\\\"  When I asked for my keys back she just flatly told me, \\\"No.\\\" I went to find a manager and a burly doorman asked me what was my \\\"problem.\\\" I told him my problem was I was being refused service and I just wanted to get my keys and get out of this crappy bar.  He told me I would get my keys as soon as a cab got here. I told him a cab was on the way, and that never in my life had I been treated like a common criminal for doing nothing wrong!  I told him obviously you people don't want my business and I won't ever return.  That's when the doorman told me, \\\"That's fine, fags like you aren't welcome here.\\\" That's when I completely lost my shit.  After the cab arrived I asked for my keys back. I was told, \\\"you're just planning on taking the cab to your car.\\\" I told him my car was at home and I needed my keys to get into my house! He finally thew the keys at me and I got the heck out of there.\\n\\nI have no idea where the people come off treating someone like that.  I did nothing wrong and was called a hateful word and was treated like a common criminal. And my tab came to around $25 for 3 beers. Definitely avoid this place.\n",

      "Tonight I was in the mood for fried okra, I hadn't had any in a while and so I mentioned my craving to my husband, who being happy to fulfill my wishes began searching for a place that offered it.  Our first choice would have been Catfish Alley, but it was closed on Mondays, So he searched some more and decided that M & M Soul Food would suffice.\\n\\nWe had no problems finding a table; however, it was very busy with only three wait staff working.  The Cowboys was on the tube so we sat just a little bit from the TV so as to keep the game in view.  Almost immediately we got asked how we were doing and we were assured someone would be right over, but a bit of time passed before someone actually stopped to ask us about drink orders.  We placed those and again found ourselves waiting for someone to take our food order.\\n\\nWhat seemed like awhile, our ice teas arrived, and eventually a friendly waitress stopped to ask about our order.  We began with red beans and rice, severed with corn cakes and hot link.  We made the mistake of ordering our meals at the same time; little did we know it would all arrive at about the same time.  I got the meat loaf covered with gravy, and three sides, what I asked for was of course the fried okra, mac & cheese, and collard greens.  What I got was the meat loaf, yams and collard greens, no okra. I don't know what happened to the mac & cheese.\\n\\nMy husband and I shared the red beans, rice and hot link and started on our meals, only to completely finish everything before the waitress returned to check on us and reassure me she would bring my fried okra.  Time passed and finally I got the fried okra, it had a nice golden color to it, was crisp and I could see it was cornmeal breaded which was how my mother always did it.  With the first bite I knew it was not going to satisfy my craving.  It was room temperature, the texture was right, but just too cold to be worth the wait.  I finished it quickly and we expected the check only to wait what seemed like forever before the waitress acknowledge us again, she did half heartedly make an attempt at an apology, stating she had all her tables on the other side and we were her only table on this side, even so, we waited another 20 minutes just to get the ckeck collected and cash out.\\n\\nI didn't get my craving satisfied, so I know that we'll have to try again, maybe I'll wait for Catfish Alley?  Would I go back to M & M Soul Food?  I have to admit I would, but hopefully we'll see better service.\n",

She lives out of state now but still schedules a haircut with him anytime she can squeeze one in when she visits.\\n\\nFirst, the pragmatic things.  Every haircut I have had here has been awesome.  Mostly I get my hair cut by Ramon, sometimes I get my hair cut by Christina, either way, I always love it.  I look really young for my age and I am not great at doing my own hair and makeup, so having a nice haircut makes a big difference both at work and at play.  Ramon is also great at changing up my look when I ask for it, even if I have no idea what I want.  It's not cheap, but it's most certainly good value for the money.\\n\\nBut this salon also delivers on the less pragmatic aspects.  Ramon is a great, great guy- he's always nice and funny, asks about family and makes all his clients feel good about themselves.  He also does a lot to enrich the community (Maureen M's review sums it up perfectly). Ramon's staff is also amazing- nice, hard-working and talented.  Everyone makes you feel welcome and makes every haircut a fun experience.  This is definitely the type of business you want to support!\\n\\nRamon has been cutting my hair since I was an awkward teenager in middle school.

I also did not want to stay in one of the $20/night hotels I normally stay in when on my own and forced to lodge in LV where you can still see the outline of a body from the police chalk on your room floor.  I had my daughter with me, figured I would upgrade to something fancier.\\n\\nWe were on the 2nd floor.  It was a little noisy in the evening, although by 10PM everything settled down after the last light show.\\n\\nThey have a laser light show with mechanical animals on top of an indoor water fall.  I found it humorously cheesy BUT... my daughter, who was 5 at the time, LOVED the entire show (which can be watched from your room window), especially the rigged stiff legged wolf that would roll out of a cave on top of the water fall and howl (bob it's mechanical head up and down).  It's almost two years later and my daughter still talks about this and wants to go back, just so she can see the stiff legged wolf come out of it's cave and howl.\\n\\nCan't comment on the casino or the food since I only was there to have an inexpensive place to sleep.\\n\\nIf the price is right I will definitely go to Sam's Town again, just so my daughter can see the mechanical wolf howl.\n",

      "first impression is clean and hipster'ish. not my scene but to each his own. barstools are extremely comforting and grab hold of your butt cheeks in a soft embrace coaxing you to stay a little longer. pretty decent draft beer selection complete with DFH 90 minute however at $7 a glass I will be opting for the 4 pack at lee's' $1 PBR at happy hour is a great bargain and the bar temptress was quick to keep them coming even at 6:59pm when HH ends at 7pm. very polite and smiley staff. this place is not my scene, i prefer more down to earth smokey stiff drink bars. but that is not why i give this place 3 stars.\\n\\nthe reason for the 3 stars is based soley on quality of food and pricing. we got the double cheese burger sliders. mind you they have a whole menu page dedicated to sliders. at $12 they were dismal at best. over charred and dry with a sprinkiling of carmelized onions. Mostly buns and no discernable sauce what-so-ever. onion rings for an extra $2 were obviously frozen as confirmed by one of my very close very well knowledged bar temptress friends. no dipping sauces included. my thought is out of a menu page of 15 sliders they cant even make the basic double cheeseburger slider scrumptious enough to make me swear off even white castle.\\n\\nbottom line go for the $1 PBR stay for the douchey sight seeing and the pleasant warmly lit atmosphere.\n",

      "This may be a buffet for folks who, like my hubby and me, dislike buffets - for the excess they encourage, for the wasted food, for the lines and carnivore centric formats. This may be a buffet for folks who prefer small plates formats and who like to have interesting vegetarian, even vegan, options in the mix. \\n\\nWhat we found when we tried Wicked Spoon during a June trip to Las Vegas, was it worked for us for a one time stop. Whether we'll go back or not on another visit, can't say because overall there are things about buffets that give us heartburn, no matter how good the quality of the food. (If you want to know what that is, jump to end of review.) \\n\\nBut we're glad we tried Wicked Spoon once to see what all the buzz was about. Overall we think it lived up to its Yelp billing. Here's our summary assessment. \\n\\nService: 5 \\nAmbiance (as buffets go): 5 \\nFood (as buffets go): 4 \\nValue (as the Las Vegas Strip goes): 4 \\n\\nHere's what we enjoyed when we went for brunch on a weekday. (Breakfast / brunch / lunch format goes from morning opening to sometime in later afternoon when it transitions to dinner.) \\n\\nSERVICE: Ultra friendly, as with almost all service in The Cosmopolitan. Top notch. From check in to purchase your pass to seating at the table, to the folks at the food stations. \\n\\nAMBIANCE: Not your normal buffet setting for seating ambiance. See photos. In particular when in The Cosmopolitan anywhere in the facility look up! The lighting fixtures are diverse and interesting throughout. Including here. \\n\\nVALUE: The cost is higher than many others in Las Vegas. For those who want to chow down on the $14.99 breakfast buffet at Flamingo (where our relatives were on this morning), the idea of $22 and change (brunch / $30+ for dinner) for a buffet at The Cosmopolitan may seem too much to consider. From our view, you get what you pay for in food quality and options. \\n\\nLIMITED CROWDS IF YOU TIME IT RIGHT: There was a good sized line on the Monday morning when we first went. So we skipped it and went back at about 10:30 am on Tuesday and walked right in. Our advice - time it to skip the lines...because if they're not there at check in, they won't be there for the food service either! \\n\\nUNIQUE FOOD: As much as this has small plate formats for some of the items, served in little covered casseroles, there are also open service bins for some things. But somehow the quantities in them suggest fresher food and less \\\"come on up to the trough to gorge yourself\\\" consumption. There is also a large carving station for those who enjoy roasted meat proteins. On the morning of our visit it seemed to include things like ham, pork belly, prime rib and so on. \\n\\nThe set up for the various food stations was as if visiting different continents or countries. \\n\\nThere were standard offerings too, like pancakes and omelets for the breakfast service, but we leaned to the unusual, which is our tendency. \\n\\nThings we tried and enjoyed were... \\n...spicy tofu with red curry vegetables from the Asian / SE Asian section, \\n...creamy polenta with wild mushrooms from the Italian / Mediterranean section, \\n...the very best item of the day, a cauliflower puree with clementines and roasted cauliflower on top (we had seconds!),\\n...plump Medjool dates with feta, \\n...refreshing watermelon salad with cilantro and cucumber.\\n...wicked good watermelon gazpacho,\\n...beautiful fresh raspberries and blueberries. \\n\\nThe dessert bar, which was huge, included hundreds of petite sized pastries and also a gelato station. This was the disappointment for us. Although we liked the tiny sizes (like 2\\\" for pastries and maybe 2  oz for containers of panna cotta) the flavors in the fruit tart,  the meyer lemon panna cotta and lavender macaron we tried weren't stellar. \\n\\nBEVERAGES: Too funny that the brunch service is offered with a complimentary Mimosa, glass of champagne, or Bloody Mary but one has to pay for coffee. (Pretty decent coffee it is too.) \\n\\nWHY BUFFETS GIVE US INDIGESTION: Even at buffets like this, formatted to encourage reasonable consumption, some folks just can't break themselves of the practice of heaping plates with food and leaving half behind to go get another heaping plate to leave half behind. Different strokes for different folks, but this is why buffets, even pretty good ones like this, tend not to be our thing. I'd like to hand out a copy of Mr. Bloom's book: American Wasteland: How America Throws Away Nearly Half of Its Food... Wet blanket that I am.\n",

About 1hour into the 90 minute class I started to feel dizzy, and the humidity was a little overwhelming for me. So I tried to go to the bathroom and she stopped instructing the class, blocked my way out and over the microphone asked me where I was going.  I was not the only one, she did this to another person who tried to leave before me. I don't believe in shaming people during yoga.

From what I understand, this was an actual working town during the mining days, they everyone left and someone came in to buy it to open it up to what you see now.  \\n\\nSure it can feel a little touristy, and catering to kids only it's still pretty neat to just go checkout.  Plus there is still a fully functioning church at the back of the property that still offers services every sunday.  It also makes for an amazing photo when 4 peaks are clear in the background.\\n\\nOverall, this place can be fun.  We always seem to stop by when we are out in the area.  Usually on the was to Tortilla Flats or Superstation Mt range.\n",

      "We don't often have need to use petsitters - generally our built-in help (that is, the kids) will take care of it for us when we're headed out of town for a day or two. If we leave for longer, then the in-laws will often handle the task, just as we do for them when they leave.\\n\\nBut there are times when you need someone else to do the task, and so we continue our search for the perfect petsitter. Unfortunately, we are still looking, because on one of these trips, we went to the mountains of Tennessee - not known for stellar cellular coverage. Only as we arrived, at about ten pm, for a weekend away, did we get a call to say that the sitter was unable to get our four-pound terror out of the closet, and would not only not be letting him out for the night, but would not be returning the rest of the weekend.\\n\\nLuckily, we were able to get a hold of one of our kids, who was on a sleepover at a friends, and have him (and the friend) come over and take care of the dog. It meant a slightly less than easy weekend, waiting to see what two teenagers had in store for us when we came home - but at least the dog was there to watch them.\\n\\nIn the meantime, QCP may not be the best choice if you absolutely, positively have to have your pets taken care of while you're out of town.\n",

      "I took my vehicle into Outlaw Classic & Exotic Motorcars to get some repair work done. I was straightforward with the owner from the moment I walked in, stating that I was seeking immediate engine repairs that would enable the vehicle to be registered (needs to be able to pass smog check) and used daily (short commute to and from work). The owner then asked how much money I would be willing to spend for this visit, to which I replied, \\\"$2000\\\". The owner then made it sound like we could definitely get the car running well and reliable for awhile with that much money. Not knowing much about auto repair myself, I inquired what repairs he thought would be best to do with that amount of money. After telling me, I then asked when I could expect my car to be done, to which he replied two or three days. I went ahead and paid 50% of the repair cost and went on my way. \\n\\nEight days later, my car was ready to be picked up. I paid the other 50% (plus an additional $100 he tacked on), and was happy that it ran well and passed its smog check. On day five of having it back in my possession, it broke down on a short trip to the store.\\n\\nWith it now running worse than when I took it in, I am puzzled at what the heck is going on. The owner's solution was for me to get it towed in to his shop, at my own expense, and pay for additional repairs. Wait, I just paid you over $2000 for some engine work, and my car now won't even run for a full week of light driving... why would I pay for more repair work and false promises?\n",

The fresh corn and perfectly cooked shrimp went well with the tamale and cream sauce.

Then I went to Lux and I wondered no more. Pretty much everyone had an apple laptop here. Me and my vaio were the odd ones out. This is just an observation and has not a lot to do with the overall rating. \\n\\n#2 - It was crazy crowded in the middle of a weekday. The place itself isn't that big, so I assume there's a big following (confirmed by the number of reviews for this place). This made it difficult to lay my things out and have adequate study space. \\n\\n#3 - Smaller space + people = really narrow walk ways when people are standing in line to order.\\n\\n#4 - Coffee is good, but not as strong as I personally like. \\n\\nWith that said, the perks here are ambiance (fun art on the walls that I imagine are changed everyone once in awhile), good people watching, parking despite the amount of people here, and the fact that its by the light rail. \\n\\nSo yep, Lux is a solid coffee spot, but I think I'll keep looking for the coffee shop of my dreams.. with table space and stronger coffee.\n",

We sat on the patio, as the lighting on the inside lacked the usual ambience. \\n\\nService:\\nEvery person we interacted with was fantastic. Our waiter (Michael, ask for him!) was prompt, friendly, funny and knowledgeable about the menu. The sommelier was excellent and was able to recommend a mid-range wine we loved based on the hodgepodge of information we gave him about what we liked.\\n\\nFood:\\nDelectable. I had the 12oz. filet, oscar-topped with a side of asparagus. My husband had the 20oz. ribeye with creamed spinach and a baked potato. Unlike the other reviewers, we both marveled at the perfection of our steaks. A perfect medium rare, warm all the way through on both, with a nice sear on mine. Keep in mind: we are steak people, we've eaten at a lot of steakhouses and this was the most PERFECTLY cooked steak I've ever seen. Everything else was great, with the exception of the potato. Not that it was bad, just underwhelming after the quality of all the other dishes. But then, it was a baked potato.\\n\\nThe only negative point we had was the gelato. We really can't complain, as the dessert was complimentary (our anniversary), and exactly what we wanted (a little gelato, a little chocolate). However, gelato is not supposed to be hard. It's not like ice cream, it's a gooey, wonderful, weirdly-frozen mess. This was rock solid. I mean hard to get a spoon through solid.\\n\\nAll in all, we will be back. Probably too often.

When we left, there were maybe 5. We had a restaurant.com coupon, so thank goodness we didn't pay full price for this place, because I would've rather taken my money to Fleming's.\\n\\nOur waiter was this super mellow guy, and was really nice. He did pay attention to details because he knew we didn't want ice in our water and made sure he didn't accidentally pour it in when it came to refills. It's the little things.\\n\\nWell, the big thing was the price. We ordered the 10 oz. filet mignon to share between us for $45 and paid a $5 split plate charge. $45?? Are you kidding me?? We started with the gnocchi which had wild mushrooms and parmesan fondue, which was pretty good. We also ordered the steamed broccolini. The steak was definitely not worth the money, because the outside was cooked to a slight crisp (not a problem for me because I like a bit of char), but the inside ranged from well-cooked on the sides, to cold red center, which is not good. A well-cooked filet, ordered medium rare, is a cool pink throughout. What I also didn't like was that they cut the steak in half for us and brought it out on two plates, just because we split it. Well, it probably didn't get to cook enough since you cut the sucker open, and it got colder by the time you brought it to the table. \\n\\nWhat was good was that your entree comes with a small crock of mashed potatoes and roasted season vegetables, which was yummy. That's a nice addition, considering most steak places just give you a steak, a la carte. \\n\\nThey had forgotten the steamed broccolini and didn't bring it out until we asked for it. We had a wine from their seven for seven list, which was pretty good for $7. The ambience was very hotel/steakhouse-like. I still felt like I was in a hotel, and I thought the decor was trying a bit hard to be on a more upscale than what it really was. At least I didn't have to dress up to eat here. They didn't balk at my track suit jacket I had with me because I was too lazy to pack anything dressy for the trip. \\n\\nSo glad we didn't pay full price for it.

She told us all the art was by Mexican artists Manuel Gilavalos y Garcia and Ricardo Ramirez.   These are obvious reproductions of a young artist who is currently very hot and exhibiting all over the world.   How has La Condesa gotten away from this for so long?      \\n\\nThe owners probably have no idea, but this is some shameful shit, and as great of a reproduction as it looks and makes the little restaurant feel,  Sylvia should be notified and should cease and desist on these \\\"artists\\\".      Google Sylvia Ji  and check the La Condesa website and compare the art, and you'll see what Im talking about.   One of the paintings in there is an EXACT replica of one of her paintings.\n",

      "I can't in good conscience recommend this restaurant to anyone with taste buds. The food here is utterly horrible. My first mistake of the evening was choosing this place for dinner. The second mistake of the evening was choosing the \\\"Carnitas Plate\\\" for my meal. I don't know about you, but my idea of carnitas is slow roasted pork cooked on a spit. What I got were hard chunks of pork that had been dredged in flour(or something) and then deep fried. I couldn't believe it was my meal when it arrived because it looked so far from carnitas I didn't recognize it. I tired to eat a piece of it but it was too horrible to eat. Instead i decided to make my third mistake of the evening which was to try a bite of my wife's food. Yuck! She ordered their signature dish which was called \\\"Pollo Magnifico\\\" and I assure you, it was far from magnifico. It consisted of pieces of dry hard chicken that had been wrapped in a flour tortilla, smothered in cream cheese and covered with melted cheddar cheese. Even with the cream cheese and cheddar cheese, the chicken was too dry to eat. The most surprising point of the evening was when the waiter came to take our check. He actually seemed surprised that neither one of us touched our food and didn't want a take home box. I find it hard to believe that we were the first people that found this food inedible.

      "After my poor, 4m old Alaskan Klee Kai got attacked by a mean and aggressive chihuahua back in 2009, she was not the same, sweet and well-tempered doggie. She would display aggression toward unfamiliar dogs that came near her and myself and would guard my fiance and me. I was in desperate need for help and asked some fellow dog owners on places to have her trained.\\n\\nWe scheduled a consultation with one of their trainers at the facility and he said he was concerned that my dog was displaying a bit of dog jealously when she saw me giving attention to another dog. He also explained that their e-collar was NOT a shock collar but was a training device to grab the dog's attention and wouldn't place the collar past 3 out of 10. I was initially impressed by their techniques as it appeared to work on my dog. However, I call BULLSH*T because at one point during one of the trainings the trainer had REPEATEDLY put the collar up to 8 to get my dog's attention.\\n\\nEven though I had experienced, first hand, how the e collar felt, I thought a 3 out of 10, which the trainer said had said SMS would never go above,  would be an acceptable threshold for my dog. 8 out of 10 on that collar is just straight up cruel and uncomfortable. FEEL an 8 out of 10 on YOUR OWN NECK/HAND etc.; it's a crappy feeling. I felt that I didn't get much out of the 3 trainings that cost close to some ridiculous price over 500 bucks....we were not taught anything outside of the \\\"place\\\" command and I didn't feel that we learned how to use the e-collar as effectively to grab her attention. As a result, my dog seemed to experience more anxiety and it didn't fix her aggressive behavior but probably exacerbated it.\\n\\nTrust me, I followed everything the trainers told us to do but unfortunately this left my dog with an unimpressive improvement in her behavior and my fiance and I broke. I don't see what I did wrong except to decide to go with SMS rather than doing my research on dog trainers in the Valley. While I'm sure this technique would work for other dogs with specific temperaments, this technique was a total fail on my dog. So, before you resort to SMS, please do some research!\n",

For $4.50 more it was upgraded with apple wood smoked bacon, shredded onions and cheddar cheese ($1.50 each extra for each item). The burger was juicy, tender and so good!

      "***This Marriott definitely feels dated and it is not in Downtown Madison; it is a comfortable enough hotel, service is good and room rates are reasonable; however, the hotel has kind of a depressing look and feel to it; it needs an update***\\n\\nThis Marriott kind of feels like an airport hotel.  Airport hotels tend to be very outdated and there is typically little incentive to do a renovation because the hotel has a steady stream of customers due to its proximity to the airport and convenience of airport shuttle transportation.  This Marriott has a similar look as the Philadelphia Airport Renaissance.  Both hotels feature an open atrium that goes up 9 to 12 levels high.  You do get a nice look onto the open atrium as you ascend on the quick glass elevators at this property.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this hotel is very out-of-date.  The lobby and cafe looks like something from the early to mid-80s.  The rooms are a little more contemporary though parts very dated; at the kitchenette sink, there was a bottom cabinet that may have been a dishwasher at one time; instead, it was empty with lots of dust and exposed piping (not nice to find at any hotel).\\n\\nThe breakfast buffet did not inspire freshness either.  The food quality was not horrible, but a lot of the food was quite salty.  Food options included bacon, sausage, breakfast potatoes, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, continental breakfast options, and an omelet bar.  In addition, the poor lighting in the lobby and throughout the hotel made the food and other stuff maybe feel worse than they actually were.\\n\\nThis Marriott is still a comfortable place to stay and has good customer service.  The rooms are comfortable with good beds and linen.  The room temperature was fine though the unit did not seem to consistently keep the room cool.  The shower was fine.\\n\\nThis Marriott has many suites so you have a good shot of getting upgraded if you are a Marriott Rewards Gold or Platinum member.  The suites are spacious and the bedroom is separated from the living room area with a door.  Their suites are outfitted with a mini fridge, kitchen sink (as mentioned) and a microwave.\\n\\nOn weekends, Marriott Rewards Gold and Platinum members get an offer of full breakfast buffet for two per Saturday and Sunday or 750 Marriott Rewards points per Saturday and Sunday.  This is a new nationwide Marriott benefit for Marriott Rewards Gold and Platinum members and the hotel is only obligated to offer a continental breakfast.  I have been to a few properties (Santa Clara Marriott, Minneapolis Marriott City Center) that are only doing the bare minimum--continental breakfast--so this Marriott is definitely going above and beyond in this area (though the quality of the full breakfast buffet, as already mentioned, was not that great).\\n\\nThe front desk was nice and helpful.\\n\\nRoom rates are good, but this hotel is not in Downtown Madison.  It is only a 7 to 10 minute drive to Madison though.  However, I am not sure if getting to Downtown Madison on a Wisconsin football game day is challenging.\\n\\nThis Marriott would not be a good property for a long stay.  This hotel just does not feel fresh enough.  It is a comfortable enough spot for a short stay though due to their comfortable rooms and good service.  If you are a Marriott Rewards Gold or Platinum member, they do treat you well here and maybe even better than some Marriott properties.\\n\\nThis Marriott has its own free parking lot.  It is easy finding an open space.\n",

I know the service express manager well enough.\\n3.  I take care of my cars.\\n4.  Not sure why the sales staff at Findlay treat me like I am not honorable.\\n5.  Test drove a Pilot there on Saturday night before closing. Wanted to discuss a trade in and the manager was not there, so I had to come back Monday morning.\\n6.  The trade in manager was not there, the internet managers were not there except for one. He remembered me and was busy with another client so he set me up with a normal sales guy.\\n7.  This guy does no research or facts, I have to repeat myself three times, he wants to sell me the car for higher than I was originally quoted. He wants me to sign a statement I will buy the car if he meets certain requirements, he wants me to show him my check to show I am serious.  I told him to stop insulting me.\\n8.  Finally, after 1 hour, and after telling them I had to be out of there by 11:30 am, I get to see another manager and the deal is done in 20 minutes. \\n9. I asked them to start the car with the clean up people while we wait for finance and all to finish with me and they don't start till way late.\\n10. End result is that I am late, I am annoyed, and I had to push them along.\\n11.  Never did they offer me a drink, like the service people do, never did the manager shake my hand to congratulate me, although the finance guy and the sales guy did.\\n\\nNot sure why I still buy from this place, but I like Honda's.  If you are looking for a car, be careful of this place.  Great product, however, the sales staff is a mirror of their management and I dealt with the management and it was less than enjoyable.\n",

The executive chef even popped out and came to our table.\\n\\nI love a good steak. No sissy steak either. I want a good ribeye or porterhouse.

As I walked up to the cashier, she gave me the price which was about $28 per person, I gladly supplied her with my credit card. She gave me the charge receipt and I wrote the tip amount into the receipt. She took the receipt from me and said there is a problem with me tipping on the card because she already closed the transaction. She said it would be difficult for me to tip on the receipt because she would have to void the transaction and then recharge the transaction. I said that was a silly thing to do. Then she suggested that we just charge the tip amount on the card as a separate transaction. I finally said we would just pay in cash at the table. The service wasn't very helpful to accommodate my payment method.\\n\\nThe seating area was not very spectacular. It felt like a HomeTown buffet, but with a little more class. The food was not very fresh. The lettuce in the salad was rather wilted and didn't taste very good. I tried a little sushi, but the rice was very hard. My sister told me that when she picked the sushi up, the rice already cracked in half.\\n\\nThe prime rib and ribs were average. I do have to say the duck was rather tasty. I think this was the best part of the meal.\\n\\nI tried some of their dessert, but was also disappointed. I felt the chocolate covered strawberries were rather mushy.

Well I took my work team here before a Checkers' game since we had some picky kids with us who apparently love Hooters (and I refused to take a work group to Hooters) so I thought this was a good choice. Uck. The wings were so soft that you can see where each feather is plucked out. Blech. The sauces tasted good, but the wings seemed really under done and the meat in the middle was oddly chewy.

I ordered a Cadillac Margarita that is supposed to come with a float of Grand Marnier.  The Margarita showed up and it was over flowing because it was watered down.  I like mine on the rocks, so I am guessing it just sat at the bar while the waitress (we were one of two tables she had) did something else with her time.  I drank a few drinks out of it and my wife reminded me of the float.  So the margarita sat there getting more watered down while I waited for the waitress to come back to the area of her only two tables.  Finally she showed up and I reminded her of the float so she took it back to the bar.  I figured they would remake it.  Nope all the did was add a half shot of Grand Marnier and send it back.  It was 80% water by this time and terrible.  My wife had iced tea,  the waiter who had the section next to us kept his tables well watered and well taken care of on iced tea and soda.  Do you think that he could come to any other section other than his?  Nope not at all.  He by passed us every time.  I asked the busser for some more tea for my wife and she went to go and get the server.  It was terrible service, then I was charged for a soda and I only had water.  Then it was a huge production to get the $2.75 taken off that they charge for soda.  Like I said the only redeeming quality was that the food was cooked properly and tasted good.  There are to many good places to go for Mexican food in Las Vegas to waist my time with Willie and Jose's.\n",

      "The newest addition to the 'Brass Monkey' family launched on Friday night, and it was a pleasure to be there to help them celebrate!\\n\\nThis basement bar sits under 'The Argyle' in Marchmont, and has entrances from either side of the bar above. I know this place well, as we used to come and do the pub quiz here every week (although we've now de-camped to the Brass Monkey Leith quiz on a Monday!) and I've certainly never seen the bar as packed as it was on Friday!\\n\\nWith it's low ceiling, comfy sofas, chunky wooden tables (some of them a wee bit wobbly by the way...that may need sorted!) and cosy candles, it's a great cellar bar and the music selection was varied and brilliant (Pearl Jam on a playlist always makes me happy!)! I also noticed a new giant television up one end of the bar, so I'm presuming there'll be great films on show as there are in the other Brass Monkey bars.\\n\\nThe actual bar is small but there was a good selection of draught/bottled beers on offer, and all the spirits you may ever want. I heard tell there was a cocktail menu too, but didn't get the chance to try any on this visit.\\n\\nAs for the toilets...there was only one and, because the bar was so busy, we quite often ended up in a giant girly queue. However, it gave us time to discuss how we were mightily impressed with the power of the new hand-dryer, and how lovely they smelled too!\\n\\nThe Cellar Monkey is a perfect place to head for a drink, blether, and read of the paper on a cold winter afternoon, and it'll warm the cockles of your heart on a equally cold winter night! It doesn't quite have the same atmosphere that the other bars have, but I suspect that'll develop through time as they settle in and really make this bar monkey-tastic!\n",

      "So we stayed at The Stratosphere for my birthday, which gave us 2 for 1 discount tickets to this show. We got a \\\"VIP table\\\" for about $79/couple (there were four of us). Basically the story line of this show is about a head vampire guy who has a coven of hot vampire chicks and is looking for love but all he really gets is sex (oh poor him). There's no actual speaking in the show, the story is all progressed through 80's rock music. The story line was pretty cheesey, and the dancing was a bit mediocre. A few of the girl were talented but most were lacking actual dance training. Plus a few of them weren't even good looking (dont know if the guys were actually looking at their faces though). There was a bit of acrobatics mixed in which was the highlight of the show, but otherwise I would say that there's probably a better burlesque show out there to spend your money on.\n",

The place was more than 1/2 empty.   It took about 10 minutes for the waiter to come over, bring menus.  On their drink menu, they had Fever Tree Ginger Ale, so I asked if they had Fever Tree Tonic or Bitter Lemon.  Waiter looked confused, and I stated, you sell ginger ale, do you have tonic, and he said I don't think so.  He didn't check - so rather than get him anymore confused I went with a signature drink, which was very good - Blood Orange Cosmo.  Appetizers were shishito peppers and fried, not so fried pickles, which were the highlight of our meal.  I ordered the Royal with Cheese, and the melted cheese and grilled onions disintegrated the bread, and not mid way thru the meal, the first bite.  It goo'd and ooze all over my hand.   I don't mind a GOOD burger to be a mess, but not that.   Had to ask for salt, because even with all the cheese & onion, it still lacked salt.    We stayed at the Mirage, and always eat at BLT Burger - we totally REGRETTED not eating there, and walking over to the show.    I have a cast iron stomach, but I was in desperate need of tums during the 2nd act of the show.   I'd go back for the cosmo, peppers & pickles - but don't want to pay $50 for just that.  I gave it 1 star, because it's not called pickles & peppers, it's burgers, and they couldn't deliver.\n",

Spice level was ok, could have had more flavor, heat level was fine.  The \\\"veggie based\\\" rather than cream sauces they tout are a great idea, but sit/walk by the kitchen and look around, you'll see big jars of veggie stock base. You know what that stuff is? Salt, more salt, msg, yeast extract, and some veg flavor.  C'mon, if you're trying to do healthy then why base all your sauces on fake flavored salt paste and pass it off as a healither option.  Honestly, i'd rather have the full fat, cream laden version that tastes so much better, at least it was natural.\n",

I saw the little salad cart, but no one told us if that was included in our lunch or not. So we sat there trying to make eye contact with someone in order to ask if we could go up there. We finally were able to ask as our food was dropped off. It turns out it is included! That would've been nice to know. We went up and got soup and salad. The salad was alright, fresh, but the dressing wasn't my favorite peanut dressing ever. The soup was kind of boring, not the normal either coconut -y and sweet soup or the tasty veggie and tofu soup.... it was just chicken broth with chopped, not completely cooked bits of carrot in it. Kind of meh. My noodles were alright, they were spicy, but everything was chopped up real tiny so it was hard to find the noodles. This drunken noodle was a lot different than others I have had, it had egg and had way less veg in it. It was alright, but not my favorite. My friend ordered her noodles medium spicy and it was a bit too spicy for her, so that's something to note. I thought the service was fine, not very friendly, but efficient.

He ordered the lemon chicken and when he cut into it, it was COMPLETELY raw!

It took over half an hour for my husband's plate to come out. I had already finished my meal so we didn't even get to eat together. Now, we are never the type of customers who complain and try to get things for free but I told my husband that they better not charge him for his entree being that if he would have taken a single bite out of that, he would have become terribly sick! She brings out the check and nothing. She had the nerve to charge us for the raw chicken. We asked to speak to a manager and she said \\\"well can I just offer you a dessert instead?\\\" Absolutely not! You can't make up for a $16 dish with a $5 dessert but we simply said no thank you. She walked away then came back a second later and said \\\"she would just take care of it and to have a nice day.\\\" We were baffled by this because in no way were we trying to get our whole bill take care of but we had been there long enough so we just left her a $20 and walked out.

      "We were craving for New Mexican food, particularly Dick's Hideaway, but I remembered previewing the menu at Blue Adobe Grill and seeing that they offered similar dishes at a more affordable price. Also, being that it's in Mesa (we're in Chandler) it seemed like a great time to give this restaurant a try. \\n\\nThe BF ordered the shredded beef enchiladas, christmas style and added a fried egg on top. I had one of the specials where you can pick two or three items for a set price. I chose the carne adovada (what I was craving) and a garden enchilada christmas style. Both dishes came with rice and beans. \\n\\nThe verdict:\\n\\nCarne Adovada: Tender and flavorful. Good, but I prefer Dick's. \\n\\nGarden Echiladas: Sucked. Filled with shredded carrots & zuchinnis. Menu stated mushrooms, but I didn't really see or taste any. Green sauce was really spicy. Too spicy for me. Red sauce was better, still spicy but not that much better. \\n\\nShredded Beef Enchiladas: Really good. I enjoyed this the most, well the red sauce side. Something I noticed was this red sauce tasted better than the red sauce on my garden enchilada. Suppose to be the same, I think. \\n\\nRice and Beans: Blah. I barely touched this. Rice was okay I guess but beans didn;t really suit my taste.\\n\\nAll in all. 3 stars, A-OK. Pretty much all I have to say. I wouldn't suggest coming here but wouldn't mind going if someone else suggested it.\n",

      "Ok, let me start off by saying I have shopped here a few times and found some great deals, and for the shopping experience I would give probably 4 stars. I decided it was time to clean out my closet, and thought it would be a good idea to try to sell some of my stuff to NBE and make a little cash. I gathered a bag of goodies (all being name brand items from Buckle, AE, Hollister, and others) and headed to NBE with about 8 or 9 pairs of jeans, 6 or 7 pairs of shorts, 5 or 6 skirts, a couple shirts, and two purses - a (real) Coach handbag and a Betsey Johnson bag which still had the the $62 tag attached. I was told when I walked in to neatly lay out my items on the buying table, and that I could either have a seat or take a look around while I waited. When she called me back to the front, the girl at the counter said there were 6 items they wanted to buy from me. I asked which items they decided to take, and she told me they would take my coach purse, my Sinful jeans, and a few pairs of my shorts. She also informed me that since it was nearing the end of summer, they had to price the shorts at the stock rate so they would give me a little less for them. I was offered $21 and some change in cash or $30 something in store credit. This was a disappointing number considering I had hoped for $50-75. Anyway,  There were a few people waiting behind me in line, so I quickly did a little math in my head and figured about $7-10 for the Coach, $7-10 for the Sinful jeans, and about $2 each for the shorts, since she had said they weren't worth as much this time of year. Trying not to hold up the line, I opted for cash, (even though I felt like the Coach and the Sinful jeans were worth at least $20 each, not to mention the practically brand new Hollister shorts I basically gave away), I quickly signed the form placed in front of me, and gathered my unwanted items from the shelf where they put the duds. I left the store and thought I'd try another clothing exchange store for the rest of my stuff before taking it all to Goodwill. When I got to the other store,  I discovered to my surprise that my Betsey Johnson purse was not in my bag of goodies.  After I finished the other store, I went back to NBE. I told the girl at the desk that I wasn't aware that they took both purses, and that she had only mentioned the Coach. Both of the girls working looked at me like I was crazy, and the girl I had dealt with earlier lied to defend herself and said that she had told me that they were taking both the Betsey Johnson and the Coach. I politely explained to them that I would not have taken that little of cash for both purses plus the jeans. (Again, basically gave away some Hollister shorts). I politely asked if there was any way I could give them back the money and take back my items, or at least the Betsey, because I felt like I had been ripped off. They said there was nothing they could do, all cash trades are final, and the only way I could get my purse back was to buy it for what they priced it for. I asked how much they priced it for and they told me $18, which is only $3 short of what they gave me for all the stuff they got. So basically they figuratively \\\"bought\\\" my items for approximately the following prices: around $5 for the brand new Betsey (original price tag ATTACHED said $62), around $5 for the Sinful jeans, (which cost around $125 new, worth I'd say at least around $50 gently used), around $5 for the Coach, (which cost $129 new on sale at the outlet, worth at least $50 gently used), and about $5 for the \\\"few pairs of shorts\\\" which probably were worth around $10 each. This amount of money is no where close to $40% of retail, which they supposedly pay customers for items. Given the fact that they priced the Betsey for $18, 40%=$7.20, I know they ripped me off. I was uncomfortable selling even the Coach and the Sinful jeans for that little, but I could live with it. However, I am FURIOUS that they snagged BOTH my purses plus everything else for so little!! I would NOT have accepted this awful deal!!! And I think it's ridiculous that they not only wouldn't allow me to give them their money back in exchange my items, but they wouldn't even attempt to make any sort of fair agreement with me, especially since it was only about an hour prior that I was in there the first time!  Not to mention they wouldn't admit that they dishonestly took the Betsey without my knowing! They said I could speak to the manager but she wouldn't be there until tomorrow.  I will definitely be giving her a call, there is NO WAY I will sell anything to them again, and I will think twice before shopping there again!! No better than THIEVES!!! RIPOFF ALERT!!!\n",

      "I haven't been to the E'n P in awhile, but I used to come here about once a month with a Meetup group on Sun. evenings for dinner.  I've been here both before and after the remodel, and I agree with other reviewers that, though the place looks snazzier, the food hasn't improved.  Service has always been friendly, if slow.\\n\\nIf you're looking for basic diner fare or late night munchies, the E'n P fits the bill well.  Having said that, you can tell that most of the food here is frozen or straight out of a container.  I've never ordered any of the breakfast specials, which seem to be quite popular, but I have ordered sandwiches and entrees, and they've all been pretty salty and flavorless, akin to cafeteria food.  The salad bar is usually a pretty safe bet, and the one thing they seem to get right is the potato soup, which comes with it.  Thinking that diner desserts are usually good even if the food isn't that great, I once tried a slice of strawberry cream pie once at the Waterfront location, but unfortunately, it failed to impress me, being of similar quality to the food.\\n\\nE'n P is a great place to come with kids, older relatives, large groups that include picky eaters, and drunk people.  Other than that, you'd do well to pass it up and explore the plethora of better and more interesting dining options in the neighborhood. 2.5 stars, only because I think the smiley cookies are cute.\n",

Battered chicken breast with an overly generous slather of honey mustard atop cole slaw. Served alongside a small salad of edamame, kale, cheese, carrots, radishes, seeds with a light vinaigrette.

      "We went here recently to celebrate my fiances new job and to use a Groupon I had purchased a while ago. As it was voted one of the top ten sushi restaurants in America by Bon Apetit, I was very excited to try it. The ambiance was lively and the decor was modern, but I was expecting more of a dim lighting, romantic type setting so I was a little surprised. As for the food, unfortunately I think this place was way over hyped for its sushi at least. \\n\\nWhat we ordered: \\n\\nRock shrimp- big portion but nothing really special. Batter was a little heavier than I prefer for tempura, with a side of spicy mayo it was an okay appetizer. \\n\\nButterfish tataki- this was tasty, butterfish melts in your mouth and the sauce (ponzu?) complemented the fish well. but such a tiny portion :(\\n\\nHamachi serrano roll- big chunks of hamachi but in a rather small roll, definitely not enought to fill one person up. It was okay. \\n\\nBlack cod- Probably my favorite item of the night. Nice big portion of cod, miso marinade was apparent in every bite. Melts in your mouth good. My only gripe is that the skin of the fish melted on to the leaf that they smoke it in so you can't eat it. The skin is the best part!! Size and price wise its comparable to Roy's butterfish, except Roy's gives you a side of rice with their dish.\\n\\nUni nigiri- Sweet and good portion. \\n\\nSake salmon nigiri- I didn't think you could ruin this but ours was served warm and oily. So weird, it did not taste like sake salmon at all, maybe we will get the regular salmon next time. \\n\\nIkura nigiri- Fiance had this and said he was pleased, seemed like a generous portion too. \\n\\nButtercream cake with raspberry sherbet- FREE with yelp check in! The cake was not too sweet and the sour raspberry sherbet went well with it. \\n\\nThe waiter also brought me another dessert, must have misheard me but I think it was a rum cake with tons of walnuts and pecans. The cake was good but I don't like nuts so i can't say I enjoyed it much. \\n\\nAfter a bottle of Sapporo, 50 off with the Groupon, and tip the bill came out to about 75 bucks. We will probably be back for happy hour and to try their steaks and lamb but I didn't think the sushi was anything special. It was definitely fresh but for the price I think I can definitely find better options out here. I'm a fan of Sushi room in Chandler although I think they are also on the pricier side.\n",

I don't have a problem with the staff. In fact, they are like an extended family for me. I'm always greeted by name when I enter and leave. And no, they are not cheating by reading the computer screen. Usually greeted before I sign in. Feels like home here. When I walk in, usually get the hellos and nods from the other regulars. What I like most about this gym is that people are here to workout. Get in, get out.\\n\\nI do avoid this gym on Monday and Tuesday nights due to how crowded it can get.

      "AVOID THIS LOCATION AT ALL COSTS UNLESS YOU LIKE BEING DISRESPECTED AND TREATED LIKE COMPLETE GARBAGE BY THE G.M.\\n\\nMy rating for this store is a -20 stars!\\n\\nI have been a customer of Cobblestone for 7 years now and I typically go to the one on the 51 & Bell. Needless to say that is the only location I will be going to after my awful experience at the FLW store. I am a fast-pass member and happened to be in the area of FLW & Hayden so I stopped by to get my car wash ( it was convenient at the time) The exterior wash  I signed up for includes air freshener squares. I had my window rolled down to ask about getting a specific scent. The man at the front of the wash completely ignored me and actually ended up spraying me with the hose they use to get the junk of the hood of your car. Needless to say I was completely unhappy. As i went through the wash I parked my car in order to let the guy dry it and went up to somebody asking about why i did not receive what I paid for. The guy I spoke to about this is supposedly the General Manager of that store named Shawn, and never in my life have I been treated with such blatant disrespect. He raised his voice and started arguing with me in front of his employees as well as other customers ( I was so embarrassed) that the wash I had did not come with the air freshener squares. I explained to him that when I signed up I was informed that my wash included the squares and every single time I get my car washed at Greenway or Bell I have always received exactly what I paid for. Shawn kept arguing with me basically calling me a liar and told me that the other locations only did it because I requested them or they were just being nice which I stated that they \\\"were doing their job correctly.\\\" I also informed him that I have been to this location (being FLW) and received them there too. Shawn continued to argue with me over and over about something as simple as an air freshener which I find absolutely ridiculous. Never have I had somebody treat me so poorly let alone a General Manager (who is supposed to be setting an example and be a leader) After a few minutes another man came up and said he would be right back with the air freshener for me ( he could hear Shawn yelling and arguing with me over all the back ground noise which was a lot considering it was about 4:00 PM. and it was pretty busy) I proceeded to specifically thank the gentleman for taking care of that for me and the next thing I know Shawn says \\\"Your Welcome\\\" and tried taking all the credit for doing absolutely nothing and being a complete A**Hole. I let him know that clearly I was not speaking to him that he deserved no \\\"Thank you\\\" or anything from me, and the next thing I know he is calling me a B**ch under his breath. In response I asked him to speak up louder which of course he had nothing to say at that point. I have never had such an awful experience at anywhere I have been a customer to. The fact that Shawn is supposed to be the General Manager is completely absurd and I find hard to believe with his horrible attitude and lack of respect. I will never return to this location and I advise all of you not to as well. Shawn is the absolute worst manager of any kind that I have spoken to and I can not believe he still has a job here. To paint a clearer picture I went to the corporate location (51 & Bell) and began telling their manager about my experience and before I could even inform him of Shawn's name the manager at Bell already knew who I was talking about. The fact that I didn't even have to share his name just goes to show what a horrible reputation Shawn has not only at his store but at other locations as well.

There's nothing really there but a high view with magnified view finders.  You still have to pay extra to ride the rides that they have.  They got this new controlled bungie jumping ride that looks pretty intense especially since it's 110 degrees outside right now.

We sent it back (in hindsight, a mistake).  The second one took a long time and when it came out it was rare (not medium rare...rare).  Just to make this wasn't our bias, we asked the manager to come to the table and asked him what he thought the meat temperature was and he said rare.  By this time, we had already eaten the sides, ate a lot of bread (which was actually very good), so didn't want to have the kitchen attempt #3.  The manager was very understanding and took the entree, as well as the other entree and sides off the bill.

Several minutes later two sandwiches go to a previously sat table. Several minutes later two more of my sandwiches. Long wait, two items to people who ordered after me. Then my last sandwich. So, 10 or more mins after my first sandwich, we received our last one. Of course, sandwich one is pretty much cold by then. \\n\\nI don't understand how their system is customer friendly. Even if you eat in, who wants to sit and stare at their food for 10 minutes while the rest of the table waits?  I have seen this all three visits. \\n\\nDone with Which Wich unless maybe I'm alone, starving and it's the only place around.\n",

      "Talk about a diamond in the rough! This place is precariously situated just off of scottsdale road on 4th ave...across from Gilligans. Had I not really looked I may have missed it and I would have been sad because this place is great! My sister and our mutual friend went here last night for dinner and had a really good meal. \\n\\nThe food: I love that they have the ability to vary the spicy-ness of the dishes, and then they also bring out several condiments that can make it even MORE spicy if you like it that way. I tasted my sister's curry, which she ordered spicy. I typically hate spicy food but I thought I should at least give it a whirl. I was pleasantly surprised actually! It had so much flavor and just enough bite for me. I ordered the pad thai with tofu, mild, and it was perfect. I still have some left over :). I also ordered some jasmine tea that was delish and my sister and our friend said the plum sake was a great addition to the meal. \\n\\nAmbiance: the restaurant itself is small, but they make good use of the space. The bar is situated in the back, and I enjoy the fact that their bar is understated so as to really focus the attention on the food. The restaurant has some cool decorations that give it flair, without going over the top with asian accessories. Tasteful. \\n\\nService: there was only one server on the floor, and behind the bar, but given that its a small space he handled it just fine. Quiet, but attentive. \\n\\nFor all three of us to eat and drink our total came to around $50, so it was definitely worth the money spent! We will absolutely be back!\n",

Ugh.... *Insert Homer Simpson-esque gargling sound here!* \\n\\nMy cousin and I were spent the weekend being hermits and I got tired of it and offered her some LoLo's, never one to turn down a free meal, she happily said yes. We brought my mom along and were Lo-Lo's bound.\\n\\nWhen we got there I saw the lil tent and mini bar of doom. I've read the many reviews warning me about Lo-Lo's 40+ minute wait... but seeing no one standing in the way of the misting fan, we decided to trudge on in... and we were SO lucky to find more empty tables than filled. We sat down in the nice cool mustered colored room, lined with Framed pictures depitcing the Jazz Era... \\n\\nWe were quickly brought menus and we ordered a round of tea... I had the Half sweet & Half unsweetened tea... my cousin chose the sweetened tea and my mom the chose the unsweetened tea. When the HUGE mason jars hit the table they were excited! I held my own taste test and concluded that Yelpers are always right and that the half & half rules. \\n\\nOur waitress was nice enough to explain some of the dishes to us. We ordered and waited a lil while... not as long as I did the first time I went. While we waited and talked the rest of the tables around us quickly filled and we considered ourself fortunate to have arrived when we did. I told them of the warnings about going to Lo-Lo's after church on Sunday... Expect an hour long wait! They whistled and said that it couldn't be that good... \\n\\nand then the food arrived...\\n\\nIt was better than I remember it! i chose the Soul-food platter which comes with 3 pieces of fried chicken and your choice of two sides... I chose a waffle and smothered potatos and a large muffin type hunk of cornbread. My mom ordered the same thing but chose potato salad & yams as her sides. My cousin got a pair of drumsticks with a waffle. \\n\\nWe were all silent for a good five minutes. When we finally went up for air. My mom couldn't believe how good her yams were. She looked like she wanted to cry! lol... and she said the potato salad was great and that the chicken was EXACTLY what she wanted!!  My cousin was inlove with the chrunchy-type crispness salty sweetness of the chicken & Waffle combination. and I, I was about to DRINK my smothered potatos, which are nothing but simply boiled potatos swimming in this basil-thyme(?) flavored chicken gravy that was sent here from heaven!! IT was the BEST gravy I EVER EVER tasted!! I was happily taking a bite of chicken with a bite of waffle and then followed it with a nice perfect smothered chunk of potato... when... when... it was GONE!! ARGGHHH!! When are they going to invent never empty bowls?!?! huh?! WHEN?!\\n\\nThere was nothing but small micro bits of potato swimming in the most amazing grazy... and all I had was a fork... but there... was still some left... and not a spoon in sight, but I could pick up the lil mini bowl.... \\n\\n\\\"DON'T EVEN think about it!\\\" My mom scolded me while reading my thoughts\\n\\nDANG! \\n\\nI reached a happy medium when I got smart and skewerd a nice piece of chicken and dunked it in the gravy and I was SO back in business!! :D whoo hoo!! It was heaven. pure heaven. \\n\\nI know very few things about heaven... I know O'odham Cumbia in Heaven... and I know Lo-Lo's gravy is poured from FOUNTAINS in heaven!! haha.... \\n\\nMeanwhile - back on Earth, we devoured our food. I honestly thought I was going to have tons leftover for my lunch the next day... my mom thought the same... no such luck for any of us! My mom was in extacy over her yams that she asked for their recipe... the waitress said she'd ask and quickly came back with: brown sugar, cinnamon & vanilla - boiled and NOT baked... and that's it. And PLEASE let me tell ya'll - she has NEVER ever done that with me before... this woman doesn't like ANYTHING/BODY... and that day, she fell in love with those yams! (Where's my calender?!)\\n\\nWe were laughing and talking about how good the lemonade is (oh yeah - when I needed a refil, I just asked for some lemonade instead of more tea, she did it no problem... she also did the same for my cousin who tried the red kool-aid) and how great the food was when I got a call from a good friend of mine. I told him where I was when he made fun of me and told me to clog my artaries... I made a face and asked him in a rather rude tone if he's ever been to Lo-Lo's, he said no. And then I told him... he'll never get how little I care about my artieries when I'm here until he tries it for himself! Only until you try it do you get how amazing it is...\\n\\nSo simple, so devine. So yummy, so Lo-Lo's.\n",

I normally seek out unique foodie experiences and avoid chain restaurants like the plague, so naturally I assumed when the family wanted to go that I would have to settle for it. Boy was I wrong...\\n\\nThe first visit we went for brunch (Sunday am, seated right away). Two of the kids got Belgian waffles with strawberries and whip, the other, the Italian Market Sandwich. The waffles were good, but the sandwich was amazing. My son generously offered each of us a small bite and agreed it was the best sandwich ever!  \\\"Thinly Sliced Prosciutto, Pepperoni and Salami, Topped with Fontina Cheese and Arugula on Rustic Bread with Sun-Dried Tomato-Basil Aioli\\\". My husband and I both ordered the egg breakfast which was prepared well and included Niman Ranch bacon. The orange juice was fresh squeezed (really, not like other restaurants advertise), and the fresh fruit actually ripe and flavorful. We were very impressed with the quality of the food, but also the inventiveness of the menu- not your standard chain restaurant fare. Everyone was very happy all around. \\n\\nAfter much debate about where to go for dinner  (we were there to go to Dos Caminos or Bouchon), we all decided to go here again. We ordered: a BLT (yummy bacon and bread), the Max Burger (has short ribs on it), Sunday Night Pasta (daughter said it was the best past she has ever had), Chop Salad (the only average meal we ordered), and a Top Sirloin steak w/fries ( I had my heart set  on steak frites, but every restaurant in Vegas starts steak at $40 + $9 fries- ridiculous!) The steak was tender, flavorful, and well cooked. At $28 for the 8oz steak and $4.95 for the fries I was very pleased). \\n\\nAgain, a great experience all around. Bravo to Grand Lux for bringing quality dining at a reasonable price. The atmosphere is fine, and simply elegant (but really, does every restaurant have florescent lights now?), but a bit noisy. Compared to fancier places with big names and higher checks, this exceeded our other experiences.\n",

      "Add me to the chorus of people who do not understand the effusive praise this place receives from the majority of Yelp reviewers.\\n\\nI've been here twice. Both times, the food was solid, but nothing special. I tried the flautas the first time, and a combo plate with chile relleno, cheese enchilada, and beef taco on the second visit. They do give you a lot of food absolutely smothered in cheese, and the prices are moderate. (Doubtful you're getting out of here for under $10/person after tax and tip.) The margaritas are $1.75, but of course very small and full of ice...I wouldn't expect anything different at that price. The horchata is delicious and made with real milk.\\n\\nSo the food is okay, maybe slightly above average. The service seems to be hit-or-miss. The first time I went, I sat at the bar and the service was great and friendly. The second time, however, I brought my girlfriend and we sat at a table. The server couldn't have been much more rude - he was extremely short with us. He basically acted like we were wasting his time and was not friendly at all. The younger guys did come around and keep our chips and salsa well-stocked, but it couldn't make up for the attitude we got from the server in my mind. Maybe he was just having a bad day, but you shouldn't take that out on your customers in any circumstance.\\n\\nAverage food and hit-or-miss service makes Mi Patio a 3-star locale...I really can't imagine rating them any higher.\n",

Instead, there was \\\"Just the Way You Look Tonight\\\". We looked at each other and wondered if we were at a wedding.\\n\\nOverall, it was definitely not worth the $25 admission fee for the Luminarias event. There was really nothing special about the event that made it seem worth that price. Plus, if you wanted any drinks (beer, wine, cider, etc), you had to pay for it at normal bar-type prices.

Well, that was an easy choice.  Here, you can only order food to go.  There is a small waiting room and there are no tables.  Service was friendly and pretty quick.  I ordered a grilled chicken club sandwich that was very good ($5.55 + tax).  However, the bread was really not thick enough to support the sandwich as it should have.

The sandwich included the grilled chicken breast with bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and mayo although you can omit what you don't want.

      "$200 after a 50% off sale for a plastic pair of glasses without nosepieces! How times have changed. \\n\\nI'm not trendy or fashionable, so I really had no clue what I was looking for when I walked in this store. That all changed when I found out I only had 5 choices under $110 for the frames alone (buried on the last display case facing away from the door). Nonetheless, I have a fat face. Let's be honest - most days it looks like an overgrown apple growing from my body. Apparently, there are frame shapes meant for fat faces (i.e., rectangular). I spent a good 15 minutes looking at all of the glasses and, of course, did not get a rectangular frame -- primarily because in that entire 15 minutes, not one of the ten employees in the room offered assistance or guidance or anything. I was then told to \\\"have a seat\\\" on an ungodly uncomfortable backless bench to be fitted by a worker. This wait was 30 minutes - and there was only 1 person in front of me. Not a happy girl here. The chick worker (very nice) was not clear about their offers, prices, lens benefits, or frame choices/differences. In fact, I felt like I was forcing her to give secret information when I asked about scratch resistance, UV ray blockage, and price, etc.\\n\\nIf you know what you're looking for and you memorize their website, this would be a fine store to shop, but you will not find a decent frame for under $170, and the 4 lenses on the website are apparently not available with all frames, because I only had 2 choices ($120 featherwates or $180 featherwates plus). Employees are not helpful, but there is a receipt book that they give you at the end of the purchase that tells you about  frame choices (i.e., after you buy your non-rectangular frames for your fat face, they tell you not to do that). You could ask for this up-front because there's nothing but posters of pretty people with pro-youth slogans all over the store.\\n\\nWould not do again.\n",

The service was excellent and despite having a pretty packed house they were able to accommodate us without any wait.\\n\\nI went with the lobster rolls which were delicious though light but I will say the cucumber salad lacked quite a bit. This salad was simply vinegar on cucumbers with dill...but the odd thing is it was served with a pickle spear on the side. Next time I'd choose a different side. \\n\\nMy dad had the coconut pancakes which didn't taste very coco-nutty but they were nice and fluffy and served in a heaping stack. My mom had a pretty killer breakfast sandwich that she loved, and my boyfriend ate his meal ( I can't recall what it was).\\n\\nThe sandwiches next to us looked fabulous, I will try the club next time. \\n\\nI'd definitely give Toast another shot, especially for lunch!\n",

      "Last on my agenda for Restaurant Week was Fu at the Hard Rock Hotel.  Lovely to look at outside the red footbridge that leads inside, I also found this restaurant to serve colorful and very tasty Cantonese food in a relaxed setting.  Diane and I were seated on a comfortable banquette and a Chinese-themed chair behind a black lacquered table.\\n\\nThis was our best bargain of RW, because for $30.13 the first course for each person included an Asian Tapas Sampler that consisted of a Steamed Shrimp Dumpling with Chili Aioli, Pan Fried Pork Potsticker, and a Spicy Wonton; the second course a choice of Wok Seared Salmon with Ginger Basil Sauce, Grilled BBQ Korean Short Ribs, or Honey Walnut Shrimp with Lemon Aioli; and the third course a Dessert Trio of Chocolate Ganache, Lemongrass Gelee with Coconut Tapioca, and Lychee Mochi Ice Cream.  None of the appetizers or desserts could be ordered in such combinations off the regular menu except to pay for each item separately.\\n\\nThe potsticker was excellent with Ginger Sauce.  I didn't find the wonton to be spicy at all.  And, I quickly gobbled up the delicious steamed dumpling.  Since I was very hungry and wanted to thoroughly check this place out, plus present a more comprehensive review, I also ordered a bowl of Spicy Chicken Hot & Sour Soup, which was nicely hot and spicy as billed, with morsels of chicken, bamboo shoots, Wood Ear Mushrooms, Green Onions, and Black and Glass Noodles--a fairly mild but still spicy, good-sized serving for one diner.\\n\\nLucky for me, Diane had a Hard Rock Hotel BOGO coupon for Fu from the night before when we had become introduced to Culinary Dropout, so besides two entrees of Honey Walnut Shrimp, we were also presented with our ordered choice of Kung Pao Chicken.  Diane got her Walnut Shrimp devegetablized but I enjoyed the cool cucumber slices that served to offset the warm and large battered shrimps.  The Lemon Aioli on this dish was subtle, the shrimps were succulent, and the candied walnuts were neatly covered with sesame seeds.  This entree was quite large in size.\\n\\nIndeed, there is no noticeable portion control in operation here.  The Kung Pao Chicken that was plunked before me on a platter was easily enough to serve two (even though I ate two entrees by myself).  But I'm a big boy with a big appetite!  LOL!  This was dead-ahead Cantonese Kung Pao Chicken just mildly spicy with slices of Red and Green Bell Pepper, mostly whole peanuts, and no visible Chili Peppers.  The spice emanated from the Brown Sauce in which the large tender hunks of chicken and other ingredients were bathed.  No filler like celery was present, and no fat clung to the top-tier chicken.\\n\\nIn the assemblage of desserts, the tapioca tasted lemony, and the mochi resembled the flavor of vanilla.  The Chocolate Ganache with chocolate rabbit ears on top, and cake underneath, was fabulous.  Even the smooth and hot Jasmine Mist Organic Tea was great!  And, refilled ceramic pots just kept on coming for the extensive duration of our dinner.  The meal lasted long because I was barely able to finish all of the fine Cantonese food laid out before me.  But eventually I did!\\n\\nThumping music added to the otherwise serene ambiance.  And, service was friendly and excellent, and so accommodating that when I asked for Sweet & Low, although I found out that it is not normally served in the restaurant (Splenda and Equal are), a server on his own initiative left the restaurant to get some from Room Service, and quickly returned with a large supply of pink packets.\\n\\nThis was a great way for us to bid goodbye to Restaurant Week just before we left for California.  And, we will surely be back for more of the wonderful Cantonese food so graciously served at Fu.\n",

The wait is worth it yelp friends. Postino does a great job luring customers in and keeping them. With their incredible happy hour, I wish I could sneak away to dine on a glass of wine before 4:00 PM on a weekday and for those who can, I salute you. \\n\\nEvery time I wine and dine at Postino, I leave full, happy and satisfied. The original Postino location will also be my favorite based on it's location, ambiance, character, service and quality products. The wine is obviously top knotch here at Postino. Bottles line the walls and the staff knows their selections inside and out. They offer bottle specials all the time and you can enjoy a bottle at a reasonable price practically every day of the week. \\n\\nTheir food competes with the quality of their wine. I long for their bruschetta. You chose four different flavors and for a reasonable price under $15. My favorite bruschettas are the prosciutto and fig, and tomato paste with cheese. The tomato mozzarella is also a classic. But, it really just depends on your taste buds because any bruschetta you choose will be excellent. Many times, I got for the half sandwich/salad combo. I like to order the Market which isn't on the menu. It comes with pesto, tomato and mozzerela. I make sure to add chicken. The Mediterranean is my go-to salad but I vary between all of their salads.

      "Pros: \\nrelatively clean in the gym area on weekdays (kudos to the cleaning staff), the early morning hours are not crowded at all, and there are some very good spin instructors...\\n\\nCons: \\nEverything else. \\n\\nFor example...\\n- two of the four Stairmasters have been broken for more than 6 weeks, another has been down for two weeks (many members, including me, have reported this weekly).  Last Friday I asked the front desk folks if they'd been fixed yet and was told that the repairman was there yesterday and they should be fine.  Nope... Still broken.  \\nA week later (today), still broken.\\n\\n- members commonly fail to re-rack their weights and equipment, even in the early hours, and the staff does NOTHING about it (it should be noted that the personal trainers seem very conscientious about putting things back when they and their clients have finished).\\n\\n- the sales staff, or rather, the over-abundantly sale-oriented culture of the facility.  \\nOne year ago, my friend moved to town and was looking for a gym to join; I spoke with M--e (sales) and asked if there were any membership promotions going on, coming up, or if there was any benefit in making a referral for a new member.\\nIn short, I was told no, no, and no.  \\nMy friend came in the next day, asked if she could try out the gym for a day, but was told it would cost $15 for a one-day pass (I'm not exaggerating... members already know that the club hands out guest passes like candy and there are little yellow guest passes stacked all over the front desk every day).  \\nMy friend got a standard membership nonetheless and had to pay an initiation fee.  The very next day, posters were up all over the club about the Thanksgiving membership event -- NO INITIATION FEE!   \\n(Message to my friend and new member: Welcome to LA Fitness, now F***-off).\\n\\n- bathrooms.  It seems to be quite difficult to keep the soap dispensers filled with soap at LA-F.  Worse, they're not cleaned before opening on weekend mornings... they're in the same shape they were in when closing the night before.\\n\\nIt seems that the problem isn't simply this club (others speak of the same issues at other LA-F locations), it's the corporate culture of the company itself.\\n\\nAnd so, despite having to drive a little further to get to a locally owned gym, I'll allow my membership to LA-F end this month.\n",

      "This is my first to visit this place, though I've passed it several times. My friend and I just finished having days from HELL  at work and we needed some vino to soothe our frayed nerves. I suggested going here to give it a try and also for a change of scenery. Upon walking in, we were greeted warmly. We sat ourselves on two really squishy couches (not comfy). Well, we got our wine order and were left to chat. First thing I noticed, the music. I began to contemplate whether or not  \\\"It takes two\\\" by Robb Base was a good music selection while trying to unwind and chill with a glass of sauvignon blanc..hmm I'm still thinking no. Second thing I noticed was that the really young servers and bartenders were talking about deep issues of the world, but it was the explicative shouted out by the bartender who was making a very serious point, that caught our attention. I believe my friend said \\\"Classsssy!\\\" in response. So I guess that if you want to chill and have a mellow chat, My Wine Cellar is maybe not the place for it. Maybe it was an off day I don't know. On to the wine prices. I've never seen a wine bar that had all one price for all the wines on their list. It's silly. Really. And the happy hour prices aren't that wonderful. The glasses are 10 dollars, but at happy hour they're 8. Not that big of a price break considering 8 bucks is usually a regular priced glass of wine elsewhere. Just an observation. Food... not spectacular. We sent back the hummus platter we ordered because the bread was COLD, I mean out of the fridge, slap it on the plate cold. The hummus was just not tasty at all. And I LOVE hummus. We then got the bruscetta platter, we ordered the basil, tomato,mozzarella, and the sun dried tomato with goat cheese. Both were very tasty. Then we moved on to the chicken sticks with lemon grass. Not my favorite. YES you CAN have too much lemongrass. I don't know if we'll go back to visit My Wine Cellar. I doubt it. At least we gave it the good college try.\n",

For our app we ordered pazole to share and they were out on it so we went with the xochitl soup. It was ok. Nothing spectacular. Then we waited for food and drinks. I asked if they had horchata and they do!! It was ok. It had a weird aftertaste though.  I ordered the Chiles Tehuacan which was sweeter then I thought it was going to be but not to bad. The rice was a bit Under cooked as well.  Bryan got fajitas and he liked the fresh tortillas. The staff here just seamed like they had no idea what they were doing. It took forever for drinks and food and for empty plates to be taken away. It was just bad. For dessert we had fried ice cream which was actually the stand out for me. It was perfect.

The beans and rice were okay, and there was some sauce for the tacos that was okay too...not exciting enough for me to remember what the sauce was though, or what it tasted like. \\n\\nWhen seated you will be presented with the world's largest basket of ultra thin tortilla chips you've ever seen, whether you are one person or 6.

There is no shared co-ed space so I went to the women's facility and hubby went to the men's facility. \\n\\nUpon entering I was given a robe and some comfy sandals. The lockers are long and have enough space to hold all my stuff. I was offered tea, coffee or water. There's a comfortable seating area with couches and plenty of magazines to flip through. I was snacking on a banana and some trail mix. \\n\\nThe room where I got the massage was very cozy. I melted unto the table and the massage was a full body one - the knots in my neck, tightness in my lower back, and tension in my shoulders were gone. The pressure was good and I almost fell asleep it was so soothing. After the massage I soaked in the heated whirlpool for 30 minutes and the temperature wasn't too hot.

Der Laden ist nicht sonderlich gro\\u00df f\\u00fcr ein Einrichtungshaus, aber man findet f\\u00fcr alle Bereiche etwas. \\nDas bleibende Gef\\u00fchl nach meinem ersten Besuch ist allerdings eher negativ. Zum einen h\\u00e4tte ich mir bei einer Er\\u00f6ffnung ein wenig mehr Party erhofft und h\\u00e4tte gerne eine Wurst gegessen und ein Bier getrunken, zum anderen fand ich mich als Familie nicht willkommen. \\nDie Gr\\u00fcnde hierf\\u00fcr sind folgende:\\n- es gibt keine Wagen f\\u00fcr Babyschalen oder f\\u00fcr Kleinkinder. Man muss also die Babyschale in einen gro\\u00dfen Wagen stellen. Damit ist der Wagen dann aber auch voll und man kann nicht mehr einkaufen. Zwei Wagen zu nutzen geht alleine nicht. \\n- Auf Grund der Tatsache, dass alle Eltern extra Wagen f\\u00fcr die Kinder nutzen und mit diesen im 1.OG rumfahren sind die schmalen G\\u00e4nge voll und es gibt kein Durchkommen. Die Gangbreite an sich ist schon nicht komfortabel in meinen Augen.\\n- Um mit dem Wagen in das 1.OG zu kommen muss man den Lift benutzen. Hiervon gibt es in dem ganzen Einrichtungshaus exakt einen (!). Man wartet demnach mit seinem Kind in der Reihe und versucht sich nicht von dem Gequengel der anderen anstecken zu lassen. Irgendwie DDR Feeling \\nAu\\u00dferdem war ich von der Weihnachtsdeko und Baumschmuck entt\\u00e4uscht. \\nZuletzt w\\u00e4re dann auch noch die Freundlichkeit des Sicherheitsdienstes zu bem\\u00e4ngeln  dieser tr\\u00e4gt auch nicht zum zweiten Besuchsversuch bei. \\nAlles in allem eine Entt\\u00e4uschung f\\u00fcr mich, da einfach zu anstrengend.

The waitress was tentative however in refreshing my beverage. you figure for a 14 dollar tab for a sandwich and a drink you would get better quality.

They picked thru it, with their forks and fingers (first place I've been where soup arrived without a spoon) and they were not happy. \\n\\nThe two star rating is being generous given the service we received during our $42 lunch tab. During our wait I noticed how slowly the tables were bussed and was amazed at how the wait staff was so disengaged, like they would all rather be somewhere else. We noticed the manager talked with several tables, it didn't look to be a good day for him. \\n\\nWhen our pizza did arrive it was delicious but we were not given any plates, napkins, etc so we grabbed some from another nearby table. Very odd. \\n\\nMy husband asked one of the wait staff about the soup and the manager came over to tell us how delicious it was. Not to our kids! We asked for a kids order of mac and cheese, split onto two plates. He promised it would be right over. It never made it!\\n\\nWe quickly ate our pizza; our kids wanted nothing to do with that! For some reason mine had green pepper instead of artichokes but I wasn't about to send it back. The kids had ordered chocolate chip cookies which came eventually and that was pretty much their meal. Really sad!\\n\\nWe didn't stay and wait for the mac and cheese. My son spilled his drink and we tried to clean it up by ourselves with the scant napkins we had. There were no napkins available at the drink station and no staff wanting to help so we left. \\n\\nTotal bust for my Mother's Day lunch. Never going back!!!!\n",

      "The Biltmore is superbly impressive from the moment you drive up and keeps your eyes dancing throughout your stay.  So much history and so much charm, this place is part Playboy Mansion, part Neverland Ranch and part Palace of Versailles.  Life size chess sets on the perfectly manicured lawn, fountains at every turn, an undeveloped mountain range as its backdrop, and poolside cabanas fit for Marilyn Monroe (she called the Biltmore her favorite pool).  Indeed, the halls are lined with photographic history of famous guests spanning the resort's opening in 1929 to present day.  (I didn't take a star off for the picture of our current prez who's a repeat guest, but I was tempted).  It makes you feel like royalty to just be there, even if you're an average Joe like me.\\n\\nI give an enthusiastic A+ to the SERVICE, landscaping, feather-topped bed, and aesthetic appeal/charm of the grounds.  I was most impressed with the service.  With rooms running $600 a night, you don't want to find out that only half of the staff got the five star customer service training.  Biltmore has it down from the front desk to groundskeepers.  A special mention of the 24/7 town cars waiting to pick you up any time you're ready  to step out.\\n\\nI give an A to the spa which could use a face lift, but nonetheless awarded me the best massage and facial that I've had this millennium.  Also to the in-room dining which was kinda yummy, but lickety-split, the fastest room service I ever had.\\n\\nI give an A- to the room decor.  They are going for that Mission-style rustic chic, but it looked a little too Hilton and could use less of the \\\"standardized theme\\\" decor.  But, the rooms were very well kept and sparkling clean.  I stayed in, and highly recommend, a \\\"resort deluxe\\\" room and think it's worth every extra penny to wake up to coffee on your private balcony with a view of the mountains.  \\n\\nIf I hadn't stayed there in the middle of winter I could have played at one of their eight pools. (I'd def hang at the one with the waterslide AND the swim up bar.)  On the flip side, it was nice to have the resort virtually to myself; I had no problem getting room service in less than 1/2 an hour or a couple same-day reservations at the spa.\\n\\n*psst* It's Frank Lloyd Wright \\\"inspired.\\\"  The actual architect was a student of his, but the big guy didn't actual design the hotel.

Wanted to take a shower after the flight and long check in prior to our dinner reservations, did not check for towels first, never had too before in any other hotel I stayed at, got into the shower and waited for hot water...waited for warm water, gave up and waited for luke warm water...semi tepid water...anything....water continued to be freezing cold after 25 mins of running it.\\n\\nI got out of the cold shower and noticed that there were no towels...like not even one...just a wash cloth.  Now I'm not a small girl...no way that wa going to cut it.  Had to get dressed while still totally wet.\\n\\nDripping wet and cold I was still in a fairly jovial mood..I was in Vegas after all! nothing was going to get me down!!  Unfortunately that all changed when I attempted to speak to someone about the cold water.\\nI spoke with Teresa who was supposed to be a manager, she was snippy and overtly rude and decidely uncaring about the situation.  Took me three more phone calls to get them to deal with the problem.\\n\\nWaited 20 mins, housekeeping finally arrived with towels-they seemed surprised that we would think that towels came with the room (?)\\nWaited for the maintenance person who ran the water for another 20mins and then declared that no hot water was to be had in this room.\\n\\nWe called the front desk again, they were very rude, told us that we would either need to move to the smoking room on the top floor or the wheelchair accessible room.  We choose that top floor as they said that it was an upgrade.\\n\\nI was mad that we would have to give up the King room we booked for a double queen....but beyond that they made the whole prcess of changing rooms such a pain, my good mood was gone at this point!!\\n\\nWe were escorted by security to get our things, then back down to the front desk to collect our new room key...it was nuts and totally unessessary.  They were unapologietic about the whole matter...we just wanted our room!!\\n\\n3) We got to the new room and immediately I noticed that it had not been cleaned in some time, the light switches were flithy, the hair dryer did not work, there was a panty liner behind the bed (gross) along with an assortment of water bottle caps and huge dust bunnies.  The view was good as it was of the wheel, however there was not much else about the room that was positive.\\n\\nAnd once again there were no towels!!!!\\n\\nI set off on a mission to find a cleaner and more importantly a cleaning cart with supplies.  I spoke to the maid on the floor and explained what I found in our room, shesimply shrugged her shoulders and said that I could call the front desk.  Noting my terrible experience with them already, I decided to not call and take matters into my own hands.  I proceeded to help myslef to the fresh towels on the cart, and some cleaning supplies....YES ladies and gentlemen...I cleaned our friggin' room!!!!!  And let me say that I do take some pride in saying that I did a phemonimal job of it!!!!  They should hire me to train their housekeeping staff.\\n\\n4) We got up early the next day and did not return to our room until almost 6:30pm to shower and change for our evening out.....I could not believe it...no housekeeping staff had bothered to turn up!!!  no clean towels for our showers (we left the days previous towles in the bathtub as is customary to request fresh towels) Needless to say I set out on a mission again to find a cleaning cart.  Thankfully I found someone at teh end of the hall, I advised them that our room had not been cleaned...no fresh towels...and you guessed it...she didn't care.\\nI took some towels off her cart, enough for the next two days...and stomped off.\\n\\n5) told the manager later at the front desk-someone named Josh-he apologized and comped us a free breakfast-thanks but doesnt make up for all the work cleaning I did...lol\\n\\n6) Be ready to be totally harrassed by a ton of people posing to be Flamigo hotel staff wanting to give you a \\\"free gift\\\" they are trying to sell time shares and sign you up for a 2+ hour presentation-THEY WILL NOT LEAVE YOU ALONE THE ENTIRE TIME AND ARE VERY AGGRESSIVE EVEN WHEN TOLD NO!\n",

      "I recently used their self parking service for a trip to the airport. The rate was the cheapest at the time so I foolishly made a reservation. The place was easy enough to find, but everything else was horrible. The shuttle leaked and was dripping directly on my head. The person at the desk didn't have any of my information ready, and didn't even know what questions to ask. I had to volunteer information so that I felt they wouldn't tow my car. The leaky ride to the airport took much to long because they transported one of their workers (who was filthy and smelled like a mix of urine, alcohol, and smoke) to their other location before dropping us off at the airport. They gave me a business card and told me to call when my plane landed and they would pick me up. I did but it took them OVER AN HOUR to pick me up. Meanwhile I saw shuttles from each of the other parking places pull up multiple times. One place sent at least 17 shuttles in that same time it sent them to send one.

I guess that means we need to order a lot of dishes?  is 20 dishes enough for 6 people?  we ordered so much food that the waiter asked if we would be able to finish it.  it helps that the meal was comped.  \\n\\nbefore heading to the restaurant I did a little \\\"yelp\\\" research to see what's good and a definite must try.  jaleo has a HUGE menu.  honestly I don't really remember too much about this meal except for a few items that stood out.  the cold almond lobster soup with grapes was a hit at the table.  cold soup?  who would've thought?  their hot soup, don't remember what it was, was memorable also.  I remember it was too salty!  another hit was the kusshi oysters with gin and tonic.  again, how do they know that was a good combo?  did someone spill some gin and tonic on some oysters?  I really really loved it.  other than that, everything else was either average or just plain forgettable.  I do remember eating some kind of beef and the paella.  \\n\\noverall, it was just an average dinner, nothing special.  the service was great, very attentive but it's vegas.  it's all about the service.  I guess I shouldn't really complain since the dinner was free.  if it was free I would come back.  if I had to pay I'd probably just hit the buffet.\n",

      "Were they out of their minds when they gave this place more than two stars?  Have they never had sushi before?  Have they nothing to compare it to?  Is this what desert dwellers consider good sushi?  Gag me!\\n\\nWhose brilliant idea was it to place the sushi bar in the middle of the restaurant, and to seat every sushi bar patron with a loud greeting in Japanese as they were led to the bar as if they were royalty?  It was cute once or twice, but all of us sitting at our table by the entrance did not appreciate the fake sentiment by the end of our evening.  It was downright annoying.\\n\\nWhile ordering, our server asked if we had ever been to Sushi Roku before in such a manner as to suggest that it was going to be a once-in-a-lifetime dining experience.  When he indicated that their food is served \\\"family style\\\" we initially thought that it meant that we would share dishes, which wouldn't work too well when five out of seven of us were vegetarians.  When he explained that it simply meant that the food is brought out as it is completed by the kitchen, I pointed out the fact that what he really meant is that the kitchen is not organized enough to assure that we will all eat at the same time.  This is unacceptable at a so-called high end restaurant.\\n\\nI had to laugh at my vegetarian dinnermates.  They all ordered a tofu dish with what they called brown rice risotto.  After tasting the dish, which tasted like fried water, I understood why they thought the edamame was so good.  It's the only thing, other than the overpriced wine, that they actually tasted that night.\\n\\nAs for myself, I went for the sushi assortment, or should I say, the rice cakes with slivers of raw fish placed atop them.  I guess not enough raw fish survived the trek across the desert.  The fish was carefully rationed. I actually took one of the rice cakes and put all of my sushi on it to make a rainbow roll.\\n\\nIn the end, the server was right.  It was a once-in-a-lifetime dining experience for me.

I was really disappointed.\\n\\nFirst - we had skipped lunch, so my boyfriend and I were unbelievably hungry which should have put the ball in wynns court. Still didn't do it.\\n\\nThe salads were great - the best part of the buffet. Loved the Greek salad and the roasted chickpeas.\\nThe sushi was average - nothing exciting. The Chinese was really quite poor. The duck dumpling station was closed and the other concoctions were chewy and tasteless.\\nThe prime rib was great. Best anywhere. The rest of the meat was only average and the pastas were dry. The thing that put me over the edge was that the seafood was absolutely terrible. I'm a huge seafood fan - salmon, sea bass I love it all. The salmon was sweet and horribly dry and the choice to put olives over the sea bass.. totally questionable. This was the first time I had ever spat out sea bass. Poor little guy. Makes me want to give them 2 stars.\\nFinally the desserts were honestly just average. There was one fancy peanut butter chocolate thing that was delicious but everything else tasted like it had been frozen or left out all day.\\nSo minus one star for sea food and another for lack of creativity. 3 stars for the salad and veggie options (great Brussel sprouts!), beautiful decor and having such a variety.

      "I'm biased when it comes to the Y since I've been a member off and on since 2000. I've been lucky whenever I've signed up with the YMCA that I've been able to get good deals such as having the sign up fee waived and so forth. The Chandler/Gilbert YMCA in particular has grown quite abit. At one time the facility was quite small and limited with the amount of free weight facilities as well as their machine weight selection but now it has been expanded to fit two large rooms with a good selection of stationary bikes, treadmills, and elliptical machines. This location is smaller than other YMCAs in the valley because of this you get to know the trainers and the front desk staff a little more to the point that they know when you usually come in and greet you on a first name basis. It's a little weird at first but after a while being greeted with a smile, a hello, and them saying your name is a comforting exchange. The facility hours are not that great on weekends since on Saturdays, they close at 6PM and on Sundays at 4PM but that's the advantage of a YMCA gym membership and that you're not limited to the facility you signed up with, you're able to use your membership at other Y locations, for me that is the Tempe Y or the Ahwatukee Y. So if you'd like that community feel gym where you're not treated just as a customer but as an actual member worth remembering, the Chandler YMCA or the YMCA in general is good for you!\n",

      "Oh.  The Jade Bar.\\n\\nYears ago, I was a regular here.  I spent many hours sitting at the bar, or out on the patio.  I grew up in Paradise Valley.  Most of my friends still live there or near to there.  I found the Jade Bar in 2002 or 2003 and it quickly became my meeting place for friends, out of town guests and business associates.  Back then, we would go there with out a moments notice.  The bar was always fully stocked with great Vodkas, Great wines and one hell of a beer selection.  The bartenders knew how to take care of you.  They were quick to make you a drink, and had a meaningful conversation while they did it.\\n\\nThen it all changed.  \\n\\nOne day, we came in as a group of 8.  It was humiliating to say the least.  My friends and business associates waited 10  20 minutes for a drink.  One of my friends ordered one of their most popular drinks and it came out the wrong color.  It wasn't even the right drink! - Since that experience, we rarely go back. \\n\\nA good friend of mine lives at the base of the mountain, he frequents the Jade Bar regularly.  But even he will admit, \\\"it is only because its the best choice for a nearby drink.\\\"  I have gone there with him on a few occasions and I am disgusted by the attitude you receive by the staff.  I am disgraced by the lack of concern for their customers.  It literally took them at least 10 minutes to get me a beer. \\n\\nHonestly, I do not know what happened!  And it makes me mad.  Because I loved that bar.\\n\\nSo fast forward to end of 2012.\\n\\nI struggled with the idea of even going back there. But my girl friend insisted that we go.  I have to admit, that I had a preconceived notion of how it would go.  Well, I was right.  We showed up and found a table sat down and waited.  We waited long enough for me to ask my GF twice to leave.  The waitress showed up and was quick to ask us what we wanted but then was just as quick to walk away when we didn't know.  I eventually got drinks from the bar.  Wow!!  What a mess.  One bartender wouldn't even look at me, he was knee deep in bottles and other crap.  I got a drink for my GF and I had a beer.  This cost me about $23.  They push this idea that they are so great with their MIXOLOGY but honestly, they look like fools.  I work from time to time in San Fransisco and I have seen real MIXOLOGY bars.  This is not one of them.\\n\\nBig deal $23.  Not really, considering the lack of attention, lack of concern, and lack of customer service.  Back in 2003, I would of had $100 dollar tabs and not cared.  I would spend the money and Tip big!!!  I have never written a Yelp Review.  As a matter of fact, most places I just don't care enough.  But this place went from best bar to the worst bar.\\n\\nMy friend just told me they are renovating the bar to make it bigger!  This humors me because the last few times I have been there it was pretty apparent their clientele is slowing down.  It used to be packed now it is pretty vacant because they can not make drinks fast enough.  \\n\\nSo, I guess my final thought is this, you can have the best location in the world and the best looking bar but a structure is just a structure, without good people, you are nothing but an illusion.\n",

The main person that stood out to me was the manager Art, he was so accommodating and went ABOVE and BEYOND to take care of me and my friend, even checked in on us from time to time. \\nWe went at dinner time and even tho the patio was closed, they let us sit out there for some privacy. The patio was totally covered with small openings thru the slats. GREAT PATIO! \\nArt brought out some wine that rarely was opened by the glass and gave us the rest of the bottle to sample, it wasn't for me, but he was very accommodating and very helpful.  I selected some white (lighter) wine that he recommended, which was about $14 a glass, I think MoMo was the name.

There were multiple tvs showing football games on this busy Sunday afternoon.  It was very crowded and the wait was about 40 minutes.  When our name was called, the hostess (speaking a mile a minute) said we had to sit at a \\\"two-fer\\\" or outside.  Mind you it was about 90 degrees.  I had to ask several times what a \\\"two-fer\\\" was before she finally responded and said a table for two. We took that table and it was TINY! I would have liked to have been asked from the beginning if we were ok with sitting outside rather than almost being threatened (which is what it sounded \\nand felt like). Her tone was totally unprofessional. \\n\\nOk so the food....I had chicken and waffles.  The good: the chicken wasn't by Banquet.  You could tell it was the kind your mother chopped up and fried fresh. The bad: The chicken lacked flavor. The waffle was small and just blah. Not bad...not good. My fiance had chicken, catfish, fries and mac n cheese. His fries were undercooked and it was visible. He said the fish was good but also a tad undercooked. He said the mac n cheese tasted like it was missing something.  Overall, I'd give the food a C. I think it is very overrated or maybe there just aren't many options in Phoenix. \\n\\nThe service...two different ladies served us but once our food came, they forgot about us. A man I'm assuming is the manager walked by and offered us drink refills after our glasses sat empty for 10-15 minutes.\\n\\nOverall...a so-so experience.

She then told said \\\"Well, you have to go over there then\\\" after I had waited in not one but two lines for assistance. Rather than own up to her own mistake or at least be semi polite about the situation, I get referred elsewhere for a possible third line. Thankfully the girl here was very nice and even fixed the incorrect discount that Tonya had put in (in addition to not bothering with my coupon); therefore, helping me save a little extra.

So, if you're going to order sorbet, please ask for a sample first to make sure it isn't too sweet for you!\\nOn to the good stuff!  Their ice cream is to die for.  I usually get almond buttercrunch during the winter and sweet corn during the summer when it's available.  My husband is a fan of the real mint chip (when they say REAL mint they mean it!) and the espresso ice creams.  I've never had a bad experience at Sweet Republic, and the staff is always nice and helpful.  I saw another review complaining about the serving size.  I think the serving size is perfect.

However, that doesn't mean I'm not tired of it. \\n\\nMy shoes were fine to get into the club actually - I was wearing worn out Monkey Boots from 1990. I was handsome and dressed pretty sharp and stylish. My presence could only improve the ambiance of this joint. One of the guys I was with had some nice plain white leather tennis shoes on that probably cost 3x as much as mine did when I bought them. He was denied entry. This means we were all denied entry.\\n\\nAlso, the fact that they allow people in who wear bedazzled t-shirts and who have never heard of toothpaste or deodorant makes my head spin. \\n\\nThe main problem I had with this place was with the bouncers who wouldn't let us in to look around... We were guests of the hotel and we couldn't get in. The first time we tried, one of us had the wrong shoes on... we went on with our night and had a good time and spent our money elsewhere. \\n\\nLater that evening, two of us wearing the right type of shoe tried to get in... it was the end of their night and there was no line and people were filing out, but things were still going on and they were still letting people in. We wandered up to the rope/fence that had no obvious entry point and got ignored. Nobody was manning the station either. It was just a few poorly dressed bouncers standing around a podium chatting and ignoring us.\\n\\nMy friend waved at them and then stepped over a spot where the rope was touching the ground to go talk to them and ask if we could get in to check the place out. We even identified ourselves as hotel guests and flashed our keys. At that point, one of the bouncers got all serious about his job/status and threatened to get physically violent with the both of us if we didn't leave the area. \\n\\nSeriously? That's how you treat guests of the hotel? We left without an eyeful of nightclub - we left with only an interesting topic of conversation for our elevator ride up to the room. \\n\\nIn the morning, after checkout, we wandered up to the front of the nightclub and asked a nice woman if we could take a peek inside. She gave us a quickie 2 minute tour of the first floor - the club looked like a weathered old cargo ship. Shit was held together with duct tape. To be fair, they were reupholstering parts of it - and to their credit, the layout of the place seemed somewhat interesting.\\n\\nOn an off-night, I'm sure a good time could be had here - in spite of the staff trying their best to thwart such a thing. I won't be visiting this club on any of my future visits, and I will be sure to let everyone know to avoid it. For a good time, head to the Chandelier bar just down the street.\n",

We ordered a full rack of babybacks to share, with sides of mac n'chz and baked beans. \\n\\nThe appetizer came out within 5 min. after we ordered our food.  We still had no plates or silverware, and all the sauces for the appetizers were missing.  We asked for sauces, napkins, plates and silverware and the waitress kept coming back, forgetting one or two things. \\n\\nWe finally got all the items we had requested and our MEAL arrived!!!  We hadn't even had time to eat the appetizer!  The appetizer was okay, not great.  The wings were large, but they were dry, with hardly any sauce on them.  The nachos just had cheese -- no pulled pork, chicken or beef, just plain cheese (I could have gotten that at Taco Bell!).  The fried pickles were so overfried that they had \\\"opened.\\\"  The mozzarella sticks were tasteless, even with the marinara -- however, the jalapeno poppers were fabulous!\\n\\nThe mac n'chz was totally mediocre, but the beans were delicious.  Although the ribs were tender on the inside, they were completely overcooked on the outside, and the top and bottom were stringy and impossible to eat.  To top it off, the BBQ sauce that was served with the ribs was COLD!  Really?!\\n\\nWe were mostly ignored throughout the experience.  The waitress was thoroughly stressed out, cute as she was, but cute doesn't get tips from me. The appetizer platter (which was large) stayed on our table (a 2-top, no less!) throughout the meal, even though trash and bones had piled up on it.  Servers and bussers worked around us and never once stopped to see if they could take some of the plates off our table. I was amazed at the tunnel vision of these employees.\\n\\nOur server finally took our plates, but did not offer to bring the check.  We waited another 15 minutes until finally my husband ASKED for the check.  In that 15 minutes, she passed our table at least 10 times.\\n\\nOh, and while we were eating, one of the waitresses kept coming to the table beside ours to talk to the man who was seated there, and to hold the baby that was at the table.  After seeing her every few minutes or so, I realized it was HER bf/hubby and the baby was HERS!  She spent so much time at this table and I kept thinking to myself -- if she were serving me, I would be thoroughly p.o.'d that she wasn't taking care of her customers!  I guess I'm a little old fashioned.\\n\\nThat amazing smell when we drove up?  Must have been \\\"piped out.\\\"  To say I was unimpressed is putting it mildly,  We won't return.  End of rant.\n",

Don't get me wrong, the musicians are good, but that room screams for classy jazz type entertainment, not people taking requests for zepplin.

      "I lived here for 10 years and never visited the botanical gardens before today. And I have no idea why, because it was a beautiful experience.\\n\\nDefinitely leave some time for your visit. We didn't dawdle and it took us at least 3 hours to explore everything (including the gift shop, which is like a garden lover's dream). Every kind of plant was clearly marked and we often found ourselves exclaiming, \\\"I didn't know there were so many different kinds of cactus!\\\" several times.\\n\\nThe paths are wide and very well maintained and the trails are clearly marked and often lead to interesting places to rest or learn about the plants that inhabit the desert areas. We went during the holiday season and the luminaria bags were set out all over the place, awaiting lighting at twilight. During this time of the year, the gardens close at 4 to prepare for this night time event, so remember to consider that when visiting. Visiting Las Noches de las Luminarias is an extra charge (and quite expensive at $30+ a ticket, but some say it's more than worth it. We skipped that part of the experience this time) and popular nights must sell out in advance because we saw several signs letting people know that the event was sold out. Something to remember. Even without being lit, the luminaria bags along the pathways were cool anyway and added to the festive scene. On a side note, who lights the over 8,000 luminaria bags anyway? Yikes!\\n\\nOverall, the gardens are beautiful and the views of the mountains that surround Phoenix are top-notch. Parking is abundant and free and there are several garden employees that were milling about, waiting to answer questions or to direct our attention to something particularly interesting.\\n\\nThumbs up and worth a visit!\n",

Our food was fantastic but when we went to pay for the check and handed him the dining credit he gave us a dirty look and walked away. When we got our check back he had already added on his tip, assuming we wouldn't tip him well...he gave himself a nice tip of $25 for a $150 meal.

We got to the restaurant around 8pm and I was a little surprised by the amount of people there. The bar area was pretty much full, but there were only two other tables occupied. Anyway, the hostess greeted us and gave us the option of bar or table, but as I said above there really was not any place at the bar. Needless to say that we opted for the table. Our waiter was quick to fill water glasses and get our order going, but he was a little iffy on menu and special knowledge. He may have been a new hire, but I don't know for sure.  \\n\\nAppetizer came out pretty quickly, followed by sushi. Out of everything, I really only enjoyed the nigiri, because all of the rolls that we ordered tasted off to me. The fish in the rolls was not bad, but the flavors were just not right and there may have been a level of freshness. I can't say for sure. The waiter omitted an item from our sushi order, but he quickly rectified that and overall the service was fine.\\n\\nI am hesitant to return to this place, at least as a sushi option, but I may return to try some of their other food options.\n",

I love tapas. If I could go into any restaurant and order things tapas style, I would. A small plate of food to share is my idea of perfection, so I was so delighted to read good reviews about the tapas place a five minute walk from my office.\\n\\nWe ordered four tapas and one dessert for two people, plus a couple of extra servings of bread to mop up the delicious sauces, which with a healthy glass of wine and bottle of beer came to about \\u00a340. This was more than enough food for us, we left feeling totally satisfied. We ordered one of the daily specials and the garlic prawns, but the two winners were the fallen tower of aubergine, beef tomato and mozzarella, and the pork ribs baked in chilli, tomato and honey. I totally recommend trying these two dishes, they were sublime. Upon reading so many reviews online, we finished off the course with the 'crying cake' which was so delicious. A warm chocolate pudding that when prodded, 'cries' rich chocolate sauce. Despite not being much of a dessert person, this totally blew my mind.\\n\\nAs I mentioned earlier though, it really was the staff that did it for me. They brought the daily specials board over to us which was actually a really nice touch, it wasn't hard to catch their attention if we needed extra bread or drinks despite being quite busy, they brought the dishes out one at a time in perfect succession so nothing went cold and they even gave us a complimentary shot of lychee and vodka at the end of our meal with the bill.

The price was about the $35 mark and we also brought the drinks package for the $12. \\n\\nWe found the food was a great selection and the waitress was always filling our wine glass up each 5 minutes. \\n \\nSo under $100 we had a great value dinner with drinks and found the food was fresh and lots of flavours\\n\\nThe waitress also told us that in a few months that the buffet was going to be upgraded. \\n\\nOn the 4/4/2013 we returned back to Vegas and booked back in with Aria, we had a long flight from Miami and we're starving. So we made our way back to the Buffet for dinner. \\n\\nTo our shock the price that night just to eat was $43 each, with taxes our and NO drinks our cost wad $97. But with a new seafood bar we thought it should be worth it. \\n\\nWe started at the Chinese section and found the food well below par. \\n\\nWe moved onto the \\\"Fresh Seafood bar\\\", I had the prawns, crab legs. I took one bite of the prawns and they had no taste, I then started on the Crab legs and they too had no taste. The taste was like they had been defrosted and left in cold water for hours before been placed in the bar. \\n\\nI left a entire plate of seafood on my table that I was unable to eat. \\n\\nThe only saving grace at the buffet is the Red meat section, the beef was full of flavour and had a great pink centre to it. \\n\\nFor a price of $100, we were left with a huge disappointment not only from the buffet, but also from the waitress that because we decided not to buy the drinks package we had to ask for water at each time. \\n\\nI doubt that I will every return to the buffet on our next return to Aria.\n",

What started out well, ended with two words....very disappointing. \\n\\nThe single biggest problem was that it took way too long to get everyone's food. Two of us opted to splurge and go for the ultimate dining experience ordering the special Top Chef menu selections.  You would expect the Bravo Top Chef Menu @ $175 per person to blow us away right?  I wanted so badly for each dish to reach the Top Chef mark and be better than anything I've had the pleasure of savoring before, but it just never took me there.  \\n\\nAs each course was brought out, I could see the anticipation of the rest of our party, but because it was portioned for 2 we could not share the wealth so to speak.  Instead everyone else got filled up on bread and drinks by the time their entrees were served. We'd been promised \\\"gifts of the Mediterranean\\\", but at the end of the night it turned out to be the longest, most expensive journey on our quest for food perfection. It did not live up to the Vegas hype.  \\n\\nI don't know who to blame for a lackluster and well below par Las Vegas dining experience.  Initially, there wasn't going to be any compensation for having our group of 6 wait for two plus hours for the main courses, but after speaking to the manager they comped 4 meals and only charged us for the 2 Top Chef menus.  \\n\\nThere were too many courses to mention and only a couple of stand out dishes.  Was the food fresh? Yes. Were the dishes authentic? Yes.  However, far too few pluses and several irking moments make it highly unlikely that we would return or recommend this restaurant when there are so many other great options to choose from.\n",

The Pool was closed for renovation during our stay (We were  given use of the Aria pool next door by showing our room keys, which was actually a plus for me since their pool was amazing!). Also, the Wifi barely worked and we had to ask for the bottled water to be replaced daily (not usually a water snob, but the tap water there tasted very odd). $25 still seems way too much for all that, but it is Vegas.\\n\\n-- No Pool (for now at least). Like I mentioned, if you are booking around the date this review was posted note in advance that their pool area is currently closed for renovation. You are given access to Aria's pool next door, just show your room key when you walk in. Aria's pool deck is fantastic: three pools, three spas, and a bar. Watch out for those $25 Mojitos...\\n\\n-- It's a short walk from the strip. This didn't really bother me as after the first day we pretty much had our bearings and could figure out the fastest ways to the strip. Vdara is connected to Bellagio via a bridge so walking through Bellagio, to their casino, to the shops was one way out to that end of the strip (or) taking the tram to Crystals or Monte Carlo was another. Just know that everything will be a walk, and everything looks closer than it is!\\n\\n-- Be ready to ask for everything. Although the rooms have kitchenettes, none of the cupboards are stocked. We called Housekeeping countless times to request things like silverware, glasses, plates, a can opener, bottle opener, hair dryer, more towels, blah, blah. There a little signs around the room that say things like \\\"For your convenience, you can request kitchenware from Housekeeping.\\\" Not sure how this is more convenient this is for the guest... or even the hotel for that matter. Just making more work for housekeeping! We received most items we requested within 20 minutes.\\n\\n\\nBottom-line, I would stay here again. Everything was high-end, modern, and such a nice break from the strip. However, I'd probably choose Aria or a different hotel on the strip next time just the same, to try something new!\n",

      "I have seriously mixed feelings about this place. But after reading the review by James L., I realized that I wasn't the only one who felt this way.\\n\\nFirst, Dr. Steelman did help my sick cat come out of a very serious respiratory infection. I will always be appreciative of that. The fees are also very reasonable. They are probably some of the cheapest in town. I would give her treatment of my cat 20 stars if I could. But everything else outweighed the good. \\n\\nIt's almost impossible to get an appointment. And when you do get in you still have to wait upwards of an hour in the waiting room. This is where the problems really begin. The waiting room is filled with cats. I love cats more than most people, so you'd think this wouldn't be a problem for me. However, many of the cats were sick with god knows what. They cough, have drippy eyes and noses, and wander around jumping onto your lap and peering into your cat carrier.\\n\\nPlus, the entire place reeked of cat urine. The smell actually made my eyes water. I understand that they have a lot of cats there and that they are doing their best to take care of them, but when you can't keep up with basics like litter maintenance, it's time to reconsider and make a decision. Her fees are so low, they could probably raise them up by about 10% to hire more part-time staff and still be the cheapest in town.\\n\\nThis place is probably ok if you're cat isn't particularly ill or vulnerable. But even if you are desperate for a cat-only specialist, I believe that that this is NOT the place to bring a cat who is immuno suppressed.\n",

      "As a fan of Tom Colicchio from Top Chef I really wanted to love this place.  Today's rating reflects the disappointment I felt. The rating is also based upon a comparison with comprable restaurants as Craftsteak would get five stars if I compared it to Sizzler. (sorry all you sizzler fans)\\n\\nI expected an overpriced steak house so the three rating is not a reflection of price so much as it is of value.  For instance, I have had 5 star experiences at Hank's and Delmonicos.\\n\\nFrom the moment I walked in, I was disappointed.  While I expected a somewhat less glitzy environment, I felt like I was in the Hofbrauhaus as the place was jam packed with tables, noisy and the decor seemed uninspired (cow paintings, really? And not very good ones either).  \\n\\nI have to give a shout out to the 5 star service we received.  The waitstaff was amazing.  Yet I found it disconcerting that the dining manager was out in the dining area discussing issues and business within four feet of the diners.\\n\\nWe started with the diver sea scallop appetizer which was exactly as advertised and well prepared so I began to feel at ease.  The waiter suggests the scallops or the lobster bisque but we knew we could never finish two appetizers and our meal. The drinks, although pricy were creative and excellent as well.\\n\\nI ordered the rib eye and my dining partner ordered the surf and turf.  We ordered sides of mixed exotic mushrooms and grits with bacon.  The sides were excellent and the grits may well have been the best dish of the meal even if grits aren't your thing.\\n\\nThe main course arrived and well I can only say I was overwhelmed by the size and underwhelmed by the taste.  The large 18 OZ ribeye looked so good in the metal pan that I couldn't wait to dig in.  But first I have to rewind.  I like my steak medium rare most of the time but I find good steakhouses tend to think rare = raw, medium rare = rare etc.  So I asked the waiter what the chef's medium rare was.  The waiter told me medium rare was red center, pink surrounding and medium rare was pink all the way through.  So I went with medium rare.  Unfortunately it came out red all the way through.  Im ok with that but I would have gone with medium had I known.   The steak was well seasoned but the meat was much tougher than I have had at other steak houses and the marbling was not rendered down enough causing a rough cut.\\n\\nThe Lobster was nearly flavorless and chewy.  The filet was cooked medium but was actually medium rare so we enjoyed it but it too did not pack a punch.\\n\\nWe looked at the desert menu but I was already disenchanted so I refrained.  My dining partner had the souffle which was not in the top 5 souffle's we have had, even at less distinguished establishments.\\n\\nSo while the meal was above a chain and probably above most off strip places, it earns a 3 which according to Yelp means A-OK which satisfies my review standards.  4 would mean I was a fan which I am not and will not go back short of someone offering to pay for the meal which was pricey (2 people, 4 drinks, 1 app, 2 steaks and 2 sides nearly $400.00.  \\n\\nThey do offer fixed price meals with choices which would have given us more food for only a little more money but we didn't finish what we had and were glad we didn't opt for the extra side and dessert.\\n\\nBottom line, while this is a premium steak house there are many equal or better choices for the same price or less within 15 miles.  I could list about 10 off the top of my head if anyone wants to know.  I'll make a list if some of you readers ask.\n",

      "Liquor World is in kind of a sketch spot.  I found this place while staying at the MGM not too long ago.  In the efforts of trying to save time, my wife was checking us into our room and I decided to cross the street to get some booze.\\n\\nLiquor World is on the South East side of the strip east of Hooters and Coco's breakfast joint, it's about a 10 minute walk from the MGM lobby.  The store appears to be ran down a bit, but it's certainly a better option for buying beer and liquor than anywhere else on the strip.  Walgreens has a good liquor selection with similar pricing, however this place was closer and more conveniant. \\n\\nWhen you enter, there's a case on the left loaded with glass wear for smoking, the middle of the floor is normally filled with ice and cheap cans of Bud, Coors, Mikes etc.  The left wall is where you'll find the liquor.  They have 1/5ths and 1/2 gallons available for purhcase.  There wasn't a specific liquore I wasn't able to find.\\n\\nThe mixers get spendy, they wanted about $10 for a gallon of Cranberry juice, where as Walgreens had a half gallon of cranberry juice for $5.  A half gallon was a lot more reasonable than a full gallon.\\n\\nService was helpful, but the place is ran down as mentioned.

      "I am in the area for a few days and was excited to check out this shop when I saw it.  I was only browsing and am not a collector by any means.  Who knows though, it could be something I could get into.  I looked around a little and tried to be pleasant with the shopkeeper.  I didn't speak much at all but the more I said or asked the more irritated he appeared.  I was only in the shop for about 5 minutes, how much can a guy say in five minutes (a lot less than I am typing here).  He even responded with, \\\"I don't care.\\\" to start one of his responses.  Everybody is entitled to an opinion but what kind of PR is that?  I then asked what part of his collection he enjoyed the most.  He responded with, \\\"I don't get in to that.......that's like asking what your favorite color is.\\\"  I said something else and used the term collection and was called on that too.  \\\"This isn't a museum and it is not a collection, it is all inventory and it is all for sale.\\\"  Well, they say if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all.  I was so frustrated by his lack of people skills that I couldn't even say thank you as I left the store.  This guy should do Scottsdale Old Town a favor and hang up his hat and either hire someone to run his business or close up shop.  Don't go to this shop unless you are serious about buying or selling something.

These \\\"clubs\\\" that aren't really clubs but are clinical elitist bars with the music jacked up over the bad speakers.\\n\\nEverything is terrible; decor, door attitude, prices, clientele, music, everything. Basically, really wealthy guys with little taste come to these places (trusties, wealthy college kids, Arabs - some of whom were my friends and dragged my ass here), and in response, comes the trashy gold digger girls, leading to the shitty decor and fat angry doormen.\\n\\nThen what happens, is the staff realizes if they do nothing, coked up dumbasses will still pay and tip the same; cuz these people are just so excited to be drinking alcohol away from their strict parents, even though they're in their twenties. This results in a hierarchy of tipping/clientele, which results in a disastrously shitty bar that is maintained by tastelessness and rich kids throwing Dad's money in the trash, unknowing that entire worlds exist less than 1km away in any direction where you can get value for your money.

      "After nearly 5 years away from Vegas, I was back. And as you can imagine, I had a handful of restaurants I had been dying to check out. Out of the five, only one lived up to the hype and will continue to see me whenever I'm in town. Can you guess which restaurant that was?\\n\\nMy wife and I made reservations a month out because we knew it would be difficult to get one if we had waited any longer. So that would be my first recommendation if you plan on coming here... reserve your spot as early as possible. During dinner, I saw a couple come in without a reservation and they were regrettably turned away. Don't let that happen to you.\\n\\nMy second recommendation would be to order the $100 Omakase option. Apparently the difference between this and the $75 option is the quality of the food; my opinion is, if you're going to eat a dinner of this caliber, why not spend $25 more to get the best?\\n\\nAs far as the food was concerned, I don't know what to tell you except: be prepared to be wowed. Granted, not all of the dishes were mind-blowing, but plenty of them were. Some of my favorites:\\n\\nHairy crab: I had never heard of this prior to my visit to Raku, and apparently they only exist in parts of Japan, but the meat was flavorful, and they pre-cut the shell so it's easy for you to scoop out the meat. And the vinegar-based dipping sauce that comes with it is absolutely perfect with the crab.\\n\\nSashimi: The tuna, paired with marinated seaweed, was awesome. And the uni was by far the best I've ever had. So rich, so creamy, so buttery... SO GOOD. My wife never had uni and refused to try it because of the way it looked and because she's a texture-eater, but I convinced her to try some, and she ended up liking it. Some day, she will love uni; I'm sure of it.\\n\\nBacon-wrapped mushrooms: So simple, yet so delicious. I love the texture of these mushrooms, and when combined with the bacon and a soy sauce-like sauce, it's seriously fantastic. I could pop these in my mouth all day long.\\n\\nSalmon belly: The salmon was cooked so well (meaning not overcooked and dry), and the skin was perfectly crunchy and salty. Combine that with salmon roe in each bite, and you've got a magical blend of flavors and texture. Popping the roe in your mouth completed the dish so perfectly. Awesome.\\n\\nWagyu beef: This was served on a skewer, cooked to a perfect medium-rare, and topped lightly with wasabi. When I took my first bite, I was shocked at how tender it was... it melts in your mouth like butter. And the seasoning was just right. \\n\\nEach dish came out in a timely manner (although we got a little jammed w/ the crab since it took some time to scoop out all the meat), and the chef did a great job going from the lighter dishes to the richer, more filling ones. And our server, Kazue, was extremely friendly and did a great job explaining each dish to us.\\n\\nKeep in mind the Omakase menu does change. There were a few items that my friends had told me about, but we didn't get them. I guess we'll just have to keep going back.\n",

We selected 4 options from their wine menu for the guests to choose from, and the staff was very engaging while pouring and answering questions.  They even made a custom bottle/label for the bride and groom to be.  Su Vino also has a section where you can get all hands on and bottle the wine.

I have been watching Chopped for weeks and was curious what exactly does he think amazing pasta is. Well Scott maybe Pasta is the only thing you should stick to.\\n\\nWe have ordered the Hamachi, Tuna, Polenta, Foie Gras Ravioli, Black Cod and the Tasting Menu.\\n\\nLet's start from the beginning. First of all I would like to say that the service was beyond reparable. We sat at the restaurant for almost 3 hours. It took the server to give us the menu for about half an hour and every time we looked for him he wasn't there. After hinting and hinting that we would like our food right away the longer it took to the point where we just left.\\n\\nHere is the breakdown:\\n\\nHamachi: nothing special-Nobu beats this dish any day of the week.\\n\\nTuna Susci: If you think wrapping tuna over a bunch of carrots is creative-think again.\\n\\nPolenta: I really enjoyed this dish. It came in a small pot with a mushroom sauce on the side. This was one of my favorite appetizers.\\n\\nBlack Cod: it was A-OK. I wish it had more flavor and was more moist. I guess beggars can't be choosers. \\n\\nDuck and Foie Gras Ravioli: The dough was chewy and hard. The sauce on top ruined the whole dish in my opinion. The inside was tender and rich. I think if the ravioli were smaller and more tender it would come together better.\\n\\nTasting Menu:\\n\\nFritto Misto: A-OK. I like anchovies but I don't think this dish brought anything special to the table.\\n\\nSpaghetti with tomato and basil was the best dish of the night! It was tender, flavorful and tasty. I would have this again any day!\\n\\nDessert: the chocolate cake was dry and even with the gelato on the side it still left a bitter rough flavor in my mouth!\\n\\nWe tried a few other things which I don't even care to discuss on the Tasting Menu\\n\\nThe bread basket was also pretty amazing! It came with 3 sauces which we ordered a second round of!\\n\\nOverall I am not impressed by this Italian Restaurant. This has nothing to do with price or the atmosphere. I think as a food critic what you look at is the freshness of the food and the service. I have seen a lot of bad service but ignoring your patrons will not bring you very far.\\n\\nSo Scott Conant I am giving you a C+. You have been chopped!\n",

I LOVED this gym and I didn't feel a ton of pressure to join (although be warned, when you're on a trial pass you DO have to check in with your sales person every day before working out). This is by far the cleanest gym I've ever been too, and the locker rooms are spacious, with clean towels and soap in the showers provided. Being a casual swimmer, I particularly appreciated the water-removal system for bathing suits and the plastic bags provided to store your still-damp suit in. \\n\\nThey also have TONS of machines, ample treadmills, and a massive amount of classes. \\n\\nThe downside? It costs $100 a month for a couple to join -- which is ultimately why I didn't sign on. It's just a little too expensive for my meager budget, but if I had the cash, this would be the place I'd spend it.\n",

I also like that there are spirit options for people who don't want beer so don't think that you can't go if you don't drink beer because you can. There are limited food options but the giant pretzel is really yummy.

      "Horrible, Horrible, HORRIBLE, Horror-show at Hotel Hell!!\\n\\nI do not know where to start. This was our 3rd stay at this hotel but the 2 other times were over 14 years ago, so I don't know what  has happened to this place but it was God awful. I don't know where to start.....\\n\\nFirst off the staff is cranky, rude and unhelpful.  We booked 5 rooms on expedia.  Each room was booked with the person's name who would be staying.  When we called ahead because a person in our group got ill on the flight to Vegas and we asked about early check in, the rude reservation clerk stated \\\"no one is registered under that name\\\" we asked her to check different spellings and before we could even give her a suggestion, she rudely said \\\"I ALREADY CHECKED IT THAT WAY, NO ONE HAS A RESERVATION UNDER THAT NAME!!!\\\"    We explained to Miss Rudy-pants that we paid in FULL at the time of booking so, \\\"if you could, please check again\\\"   She disconnected us. We called back, asked for a manger and was on hold for over 35 minutes.  Finally we called the main reservation line and the customer service was able to find the booking. Our party was  able to check in early, for a small fee, which she tried to give cash but it was not accepted.  Our friend used her debit card and was charged a  $100 deposit without being told this would happen and that of course made her short in her bank account. (college student).\\n\\nWe checked into our room and almost slipped and fell on a large puddle on the floor. The AC was leaking.  A call to the front desk was met with another snotty customer rep who was more interested in the fact that 2 in our party were 19 and 20 1/2 and  had their own rooms. Her suggestion was we should all sleep together in the same bed like hillbillies.  Not to mention we were charged a $100 deposit for each of the rooms occupied by those under 21 and the front desk NEVER  mentioned any problems or rules about under 21 guests occupying a room.\\n\\nWe were never offered another room. The maintence guy showed up and said \\\"oh that is just a little condensation\\\"   It was about 12 inches around and on a dark floor. Guess Flamingo does not care if we break a hip in a fall in their room.  The condition apparently has been on going as the room smelled of mold.\\n\\nProblem fixed we moved on to the pool area.  They have a section for 21 and over. Just a heads up, prepare to undergo a full body search by an armmed guard. Oh...if you buy a coffee at Mrs. Fields prior to going into the pool, better drink it fast cause, as the guard said \\\"NO FOOD, NO DRINK FROM OUTSIDE\\\"  WTF??   We bought it a few feet away inside the hotel.   The guard also does not like tampons in your purse or he was a total moron because he pulled out the package and asked \\\"what's this\\\".\\n\\nNext night at  4am, the A/C again dripped and dripped.  Call to the front desk, waiting 45 mins, no show.  Call a second time waited 2 hours, again a no show. Finally gave up.\\n\\nStaff is untrained, rude and nasty.  We asked one employee what time the restaurant was open til and was told \\\"oh it closed\\\" only to find out it is a 24 hour place!!  \\n\\nI guess the Korean tourist summed it up best when he let one smelly fart rip  while we tried to enter our room!

      "If you literally want to die, or care VERY little about your life- by all means visit this Walmart.\\n\\nI swear to you this Walmart has given me mental issues. Every time I pull into the parking lot my hands LITERALLY start trembling from the fear of entering this awful hellish pit of horridness. \\n\\nSince it is the only Walmart near Central Phoenix, there are no alternatives. There have been days when I HAVE to get something from Walmart (I avoid it by all means believe me) and EVERY time I go in to the temple of doom, I come out more mentally damaged.\\n\\nLet me start off by writing a list of why this Walmart is so AWFUL:\\n\\n-The parking lot smells like pee and rotten meat.\\n-The parking lot has the craziest cars in it with the most ridiculous car decals on them. For example: \\\"R.I.P ______\\\"... only there are 7 different names on the car!! \\n-There are thugs in the parking lot who will stare at you! They are just standing there, watching people, it's like.. Really?\\n-People ask you for money from left and right in the parking lot. It's like, I'm resorting to coming to Walmart, do you think I'm shelling out dollar bills?\\n-When you enter the store- it is horrible. \\n-People fight at this Walmart! Couples cussing each other out accross the bread isle, dirty kids running around without being supervised by their parents (kidnap danger!), meth heads, weirdos, gross people, crazy people ect. One time I was in the dry fruit section and this guy threw a can of cashews at this girl while saying, \\\"Well then, f* you b*!\\\". No one did anything...\\n-The lines are SUPER long and they have VERY few cashiers. No other Walmart is this bad. I am always in line over 20 minutes at this Walmart!\\n-The employees are AWFUL. They will literally tell you they do not care. They are scary looking and often try to intimidate you.\\n-People are selling CDs and magazine subscriptions INSIDE the Walmart!\\n-People harass you for money INSIDE the Walmart and will call you a b* if you do not give them money (happened to me while I was buying scented candles) *tear*\\n-Security literally ignores  you when you approach them about people harassing you at Walmart. \\n-The employees talk to each other about inappropriate things in front of everyone (even kids). \\n-Everything is dirty and disorganized.\\n-Weirdos follow you around the store.\\n-You literally feel that you will get mugged or raped while walking to your car, especially at night (scary feeling!).\\n\\nSo now, instead of dealing with all this trauma, I go around to my beloved Target on the other side of the shopping center. There is a security guard (sometimes 2) at the door. The shoppers are normal people. The parking lot is the complete opposite of the Walmart one. The store is clean and organized. The employees are normal and are actually nice to you. \\n\\nOverall, BEWARE of this Walmart! If you find yourself here, RUN AWAY. FAST.\n",

Apparently they were too busy for this as a party of 20 called right before us.  To my surprise we were seated right away.  If you like Blood Mary's I recommend trying their Bloody Mary bar-lots of great add ins. They also have unlimited mimosas for $14.  I went with the waffle slider which was a sunny side up egg, sausage, gyre cheese and arugula in between 2 waffles.  I asked for a fried egg which they did not do, the sausage was McDonalds quality at best and the waffles were saggy. It was served with a side of potatoes which were delicious.  My other big complaint is that a friend ordered an omelet and wanted egg whites which they would not accommodate saying that they were too busy.  Our orders took a while to be served but they were so busy for a Sunday. I say skip the brunch and go for drinks. I would like to go back and try happy hour.\n",

      "***LONG OVER DUE REVIEW INCOMING IN 3...2...1...\\n\\nStanding in line for check in with my buddies, I noticed some really noticeable and some not so noticeable things.  The most noticeable was the heavy smoke inside the casino.  Occasional faded stains on the carpets in the casino were also very noticeable.  Somewhat not so noticeable was the feeling that you weren't in Vegas.  Another not so noticeable fact is the crowded nature of the counter to the beginning of the casino.  The latter may not seem like of much importance.  In perspective of dialogue that will be presented, significance may arise.  Now after using the word \\\"noticeable\\\", a noticeable amount of times, I'll continue.   \\n\\n-Hotel Clerk:  Hi, how can I help you?\\n\\n-Arnold (me obviously): Uh...we'd like to check into our rooms.  \\n\\n*HOTEL CLERK CLICKS AWAY AT THE COMPUTER AND SCANS THE ROOM KEYS.   \\n\\nHotel Clerk:  Alright, here are your room keys.  Have you stayed with us before?\\n-Arnold:  This will be my first.\\n\\n*HOTEL CLERK GATHERS MORE PAPERS INCLUDINGS COUPONS AND A MAP...YES, A MAP.  Looking down at the map, I knew this was going to bad news.\\n\\n-Hotel Clerk: Beginning here facing the front of the casino...\\n\\nNoises of the casino around me start coming into the forefront.  The rings and conversations around me start entering my ear.  A.D.D. begins to rage, can't focus.  I turn around for a second to scan the area again...\\\"Hey! There's a fake Elvis dealing blackjack!  That's funny.\\\"...then I turn back around at the map.  \\n\\n-Hotel Clerk: ...and that is how you'll get to the rooms.\\n\\nI looked down at the map.  She, the clerk, had given me a descriptive way to get to our rooms while drawing on the map in a directional pattern that reminded me of a maze from one of those kid's maze books.  It was all squiggles to me.   \\n \\n-Arnold: Could you show me that again?  \\n\\n-Hotel Clerk:  So we are here.  Now you'll walk...corridor...blah blah blah...stairway...blah blah blah...and you'll be right there.  Got it?\\n\\nStaring at the pen on the desk and at the shape and curvature of the objects near the computer, I recalled the combination of items with center of attention resembling hamburger and fries.  I must have been hungry.  One thing is certain; I have a hard time focusing when I really need to at times.  Did mention anything about raging A.D.D.?  \\n\\n-Arnold:  Yup, I got it.   \\n\\nThis is going to be embarrassing I thought.  I followed the map the best I could.  We each took turns looking at the map.  Going up and down stairs, trying to follow the number of the rooms, you'll see that different sections start and finish another set of room numbers.  Simple to say, the search was complicated.  After about 10-20- minutes of wandering around, we eventually found our rooms.  Now I know how Moses in the desert felt...at least for 10-20 minutes.    \\n\\nOur rooms were sleep-able.  Everything worked and things looked fine considering the expectations.  Unfortunately, the fact everything in the room looked like it hadn't changed since the 1980's may lead one to believe it isn't as clean as it can be.      \\n\\nIn a nutshell, luxury and Imperial Palace are like oil in water.  Don't expect them to mix.  So throw out special amenities you think you might get.  Within the immediate future, a discount stay for ones on a budget pinch, IP sits on a very respectable spot on The Strip.  This prime location will be torn down and replaced with another resort, so days of this politically incorrectly themed hotel and casino is coming to an end.\n",

It is a one time fee and it covers you for life. That's okay, not interested. She continued to tell me that my purchase today would cover a good percentage of the fee. Still no. After the final dismissal, her attitude changed. She swiped my card and instead of handing it back to me, tossed it on the counter. She tossed the pen beside it.

When I got her back I was really surprised at how much hair she had.  They managed to not shave her off completely, get rid of all her matting, and keep a good length of hair on her. I was extremely happy! They really listened to what I said. \\n\\nAnother thing I love about this place is the price! The other groomers I went to would charge me extra to get rid of the matting so I was expecting that too, but they didn't charge me 1cent more than what we had previously discussed on the phone. It only cost me $45 for everything: bath, cut, ears cleaned, and nails trimmed. That's a pretty good price compared to the others I've been to. They also have a $5 off coupon if you check in, so really it only cost $40. STEAL! \\n\\nBest In Show Dog Grooming is my new permanent dog groomers.

The scallops had a sour after taste to them which I attributed to being in the smoker way too long, and they needed a better sear.  The wild boar meatballs needed more seasoning. The duck confit relleno was pretty good, but the batter was oily and fell right off the chile.\\n\\nNext off, we got seated in the brightly lit room to the left as you walk in.  The room resembles nothing of the ambiance of the rest of the place.  I was turned off by the faux wall artwork.  The waitress seemed rush every time she came to us, and it showed with her missing our mushroom pan fry order.\\n\\nIt's hard to explain what it was like being there.  Have you ever gone to a restaurant, and you just wanted to leave after being there for 10 minutes?  Bad service, so so food, and being in a room that reminded me of the olive garden leads to wholly bad experience.\\n\\nWith so many other good restaurants such as NOCA, FNB, Herb Box near by, I won't ever recommend this place to anyone again.\n",

I ate here a month ago and loved it and was so excited to come back tonight with friends for a belated birthday celebration. I am writing this from the parking lot -- that's how bad an experience it was.\\n   The sausage pasta dish was nothing like the last time, when it was the hit of the night. . The texture was like paste. We sent it back and when the server returned with a new order she said: chef wants you to know we are experimenting with different wheats and it's all matter of personal taste and palates. In other words, if you don't like it you don't have good taste. We chewed through the toughness -again - because we were so hungry. The only good part was the sausage.\\n  Service was a comedy of errors. We got our neighbors' appetizers, much to their dismay.\\n   It's 114 today and was over 90 degrees in the restaurant. The hostess just said she \\\"thought\\\" the AC was out. The people next to us were fanning themselves with their menu. Other people moved tables to try to get cooler but the hostess told us we had one of the best spots in the house.\\n    Our waitress made no attempt to apologize for any of this mess and dropped the check off with no comment or even the slightest bit of recognition -or discount /free meal - for the troubles. Not even an acknowledgement that this place was firing on NO cylinders tonight.\\n Absolutely stunning. It was like the whole place was in an alternate universe where everything was peachy keen tonight. There were some high Profile PHX area biz and foodie  diners there tonight whom I will not mention.

      "If I can give them negative stars, I would. DO NOT BUY any puppies from Petland or any pet stores. By doing this, you are simply supporting puppymills. And these puppymills will continue to practice and produce bad breeding because people buy them. A reputable breeder WILL NEVER EVER sell their puppies to a business instead of finding them a great home. The \\\"It's not where it's from, it's where it is going\\\" is simply an excuse. Granted, you want the cute little puppy you can raise and call it your own. I've been there. But please do your research and look what's available in rescues. There are reputable breeders all over the country that cares about their puppies and will provide you a health warranty for congenital and hereditary conditions. Speaking of \\\"warranty\\\" Petland claims  \\\"WarrantyWe Stand Behind the Puppies We Sell: Our puppies come with a 14 day warranty covering infectious and contagious diseases and a 1 year warranty covering congenital and hereditary conditions.\\\" Guess what? They don't. 3 weeks ago, I adopted the sweetest and the calmest 7 month old Siberian husky from a couple who didn't have time for him due to their busy work schedule and renamed him Sawyer. I already have one named Yuka, so I took him in without a second thought so that Yuka will have a playmate. The couple bought him originally from Petland in April this year. Everything was fine until I started noticing that he seemed to have poor judgment on distances. He appears to be clumsy and frequently tripping, bumping into furniture, and stumbling during walks. So Sunday, 9/21/14, I brought him to the vet for an overall health check up. I was told that he has Hereditary Juvenile Cataracts. I immediately brought him to an Eye Specialist the following day 9/22/14. The eye doctor confirmed it and I was devastated. I contacted the original owner and was told he still has a warranty. I called Petland Henderson and they referred me to file a claim to Pawsitive Solutions. I hang up and called Pawsitive Solutions right away. After explaining to the manager about Sawyer's condition, HE DENIED his warranty. He bluntly said \\\"UNFORTUNATELY, THERE WILL BE NO WARRANTY BECAUSE YOU ADOPTED HIM.\\\" I cannot believe what I heard. For someone who is taking care of a dog that is going blind, I cannot contain my frustrations as these people are just simply there to make money. They couldn't care less about the puppies they sell and will find a way to avoid having to deal with their so-called \\\"warranty\\\".\n",

I'd have to say that I didn't think much of them.  The presentation was beautiful, I must admit, but paying $10 for what amounted to about a teaspoon and a half (OK, for argument's sake, let's round it off to two teaspoons) of frothy fat accented with Hawai'ian sea salt and tawny port reduction did not translate to a great experience for me (taste, nutrition, or cost).  Sure, there were a bit of bitter greens and three toasted pieces of bread (which two teaspoons of fat could not even cover), but I found more joy and sustenance w/ the singular toast slice slathered w/ goat cheese (forgive me, it's been awhile since I had this app, but the spread could've been mascarpone and ricotta, but I want to say goat cheese) and slices of Campari tomatoes.  Happy hour price for this app was $4.50, which I found easier to swallow, pardon the pun, than to pay $9 for a singular slice of toast w/ a soft-cheese spread and a little bitter greens on top.  (I can't eat tomatoes, so those gourmet slices just ended up in the garbage bin.)  It was very tasty, however, so I may order it again, but I won't be very happy about it.

I asked the server if it was processed cheese, or \\\"real\\\" cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what I was talking about. I tried to clarify by saying, \\\"Is it like Kraft single slices, or deli cheese?\\\" He said it was \\\"good\\\". This really should have been a sign and I could probably fault the waiter for this, since you SHOULD know what you're serving, but he was so sweet, I couldn't be mad!\\n\\nMy husband ordered a hot dog of sorts.\\n\\nI asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad. There was not, but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway (no charge). I asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich.\\n\\nOf course, my sandwich was made with plasticy, processed cheese, that was melted to the point of Cheeze-Wiz and was inedible. I took one bite of the sandwich and couldn't do another. I got regular fries, instead of sweet potato (didn't bother complaining, because I got the free salad, so whatever...like I said, nice server!) My husband's food was fine, although nothing special.

      "I was in town for  2 days of course had to check out the local Bikram Yoga studio.  It was the closest off the strip after all. (part of their marketing..)  Technically, it was about a 15 minute drive. Glad I rented a car and didn't take a cab. \\n\\nThe owner checked me in and  was familiar with the owner here, by name. I was impressed. He did ask me if I took a cab so, if needed they could have a cab ready for me after class. Also impressive!  The studio was whistle clean. I'm not sure what these other folks were yelping about.  A lot of Hot Yoga studios do smell like dirty feet. This place did not!  Yes, the room did have carpet but whatever the fiber was, didn't hold onto sweat or stink. Yes, the room was hot. It's known as hot yoga for a reason. Anyone who attends Bikram knows they can lay down on the mat at anytime (Savasana). \\n\\nMy first day of class had about 40 people and second about 30. I had Marie one day and Amy the next.  Marie was over the top happy. It must have been that Vegas sunshine. And Amy, she just came back from teaching in India. She told us a few times while clutching onto a cup of coffee. Both teachers were great and kept us inspired. \\n\\nA tip ~ if you're traveling bring a your own yoga towel if you have one. Rental mats and towels are a little expensive and if you're tall like me, the towel only covers about 60% of the mat. Traveling with a towel would have been easy to do.  Second, they don't offer baggies in the dressing room. All the other studios I've been to offer this. They are recycled bags or small garage bags. It's great to put your damp clothes into. I did ask for one and they find me one but this service should automatically be provided.\n",

I have probably driven by it hundreds of times while going up 32nd St. after passing McDowell but before Thomas but never payed any mind to it. \\n\\nI gave it three stars and some easy fixes could make it four. To start the young woman answering the phone was friendly, smart and helpful. I told her I was on yelp looking at pictures of previous menus since the old website was dead(just submitted request for yelp mod to update). She told me the new site and helped me pick dishes and said food ready will be ready in less than ten minutes. When I get there it was ready but since they have only have two phone lines I had to wait 5-10 minutes until the card could be processed. The majority of the crew is Asian the manager/owner looks to be something other than Asian , likely eastern European middle Eastern. He was taking an order and someone in house was talking on the other line so no way to have my payment go through. He apologized and thanked me for my patience.  \\n\\nOrdered Spicy chicken wings came with free egg rolls. Beijing style Hot & Sour Chichken and Mongolian Beef. Came out to about 20 bucks. \\n\\nWings appeared fried with very light batter and some type of chili sauce drizzled across the top. Though it doesnt sound exciting I would get it again. The egg rolls were big and even though they were free I wouldn't mind paying for them next time. The chicken dish had like an orange chicken vibe more doughy not a lotta flavor. As you can see very generous portion but not my style. The mongolian beef had a good sauce and as you can see is mostly white onions shallots and beef. The beef was cooked right decent cut but I onions to beef ratio was opposite of what I expected. \\n\\nI hope to find some new dishes to try that I like.\n",

      "Brocach was just what I needed to satisfy my fill of Irish ambiance. Thankfully I had Yelp to rely on while searching for Irish grub last week.  Carol K.'s review peaked my interest and did not disappoint.  Thank you Carol K.!\\n\\nWe were there on a Tuesday night hoping to enjoy good Irish food and traditional Irish music.  We didn't get the live Irish music (not surprising on a Tuesday night), but we listened to Irish music piped throughout the restaurant while enjoying our Irish dinner and traditional Irish beverages.  \\n\\nCait was our waitress and was on point with her recommendations and timely check-ins.  Cait shared the drink specials which allowed us to have more of what we originally requested (plus an extra shot of whiskey for another $1!).  This was such a good deal that I'm sharing the breaksdown of this special.\\n\\nDRINKS:\\nHusband's Irish beverage of choice:\\n -Guinness - reg. $5.25 (half-pints available for $3.75)\\n - John Powers - reg. $5.25 (2 oz. shot of Irish Whiskey)\\n*Special = $6.25 for a pint of Guiness and shot of John Powers\\n\\nWendy's Irish beverage of choice:\\n - Jameson and coke is what I requested; however, Cait's recommendation was to take advantage of the *half-priced Irish Whiskey & Scotch special and upgrade to the 18 yr. Jameson with a coke on the side.  It was perfect...and I only had to cough up $6.00!\\n\\nFOOD:\\nMy husband enjoyed the shepards pie and said it was good, but needed more meat, veggies, and gravy to go along with the heap of mashed pototoes. He can't wait to come back and try the Irish Stew.  I ordered the fish and chips.  You can't go wrong with Harp battered haddock filets. Everything was very fresh and with just enough fish and a good portion of \\\"chips\\\". I probably ate too many of the chips since they were really good and I can't stop once I start eating them with the malt vinegar.  Certain meals are served with brown bread and I think it would be a nice touch for them to include Kerry Gold butter on the side. It's from Ireland and it's good...no need to elaborate.\\n\\nMUSIC/AMBIANCE:\\n - Music lineup is good if you can catch them on the right days and times.  \\n - Live Irish music on various evenings...approx. 7 nights per month.\\n - Great ambiance with traditional feel throughout the restaurant and pub area.  \\n - There is also a second floor (which I did not go up to) and you can view an interior balcony area from the first floor of the restaurant.\\n\\nTIPS: \\n - Check out the music lineup on my photo (as of Nov. 2011).  It is not on their website.\\n - Happy Hour is every day 3-6PM and 10PM - Close\\n - All you can eat Fish Fry on Friday's.  $15 from 4:30 - 10PM\\n - I saw a sign in the restroom that promoted Private Parties with no party room charges.\\n - Trivia night: Sunday @8PM w/ drink specials and prizes\\n - Brocach is pronounced BROH-kaw\\n - Parking can be tricky.  Some meters have 15 min limits or 1 hour limits, but will take all of your coins if you drop them in the meter.  I was a little confused since our meter indicated a 15 min limit with a 1.5 hour max time.  \\n\\nI will definitely be returning to Brocach whenever I'm in Madison.  Hopefully, the Irish bands will coincide with my schedule. I'd also be interested in trying them out for breakfast sometime. My standards are pretty high for a proper Irish breakfast...so Brocach, I hope you're ready!\\n\\nSl\\u00e1inte!\n",

      "The girlfriend and I were in for the weekend for the Vegas Uncork'd event.  We had stayed at the Cosmopolitan for our first night, but moved over to the Paris for the Fri-Mon part of our stay since they offered a much better rate for Fri and Sat nights and comped our Sun night.  Despite this much better deal, I really wish we would've just paid the cash and stayed put at the Cosmo.\\n\\nTo be sure, Paris is one of the most identifiable places on the Strip with its half-scale replica of the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe.  I've never been to Paris, but I have to admit the faux Eiffel Tower still looks impressive.  The interior of the casino attempts to imitate the look of Paris in a Disney kind of way.  The casino floor has the requisite number and variety of table games, slots and video poker machines of all denominations.   Cocktail waitresses are decked out like Parisian gendarmerie.  There are multiple bars and restaurants scattered about the facility although none of the restaurants appealed to me compared to the other offerings available at other properties along the Strip or around Vegas.\\n\\nThe biggest fault I found with Paris was their rooms.  The bed in our room was stiff and unforgiving....easily one of the worst I've encountered in any of my stays in Vegas.  It certainly couldn't compare to some of the much better beds I've slept in at the Palms, Hard Rock, and most recently, the Cosmopolitan.  Unlike many Vegas properties, the Paris doesn't offer a HD flat-panel TV in their rooms.  While we didn't watch any TV in our room, it would've been more impressive if the Paris was more current in their furnishings and amenities.  Also, unlike the Cosmopolitan which offered free wi-fi, the Paris charged $15 per day for wi-fi.  At least the room was clean and quiet and the maid service did a good job.\\n\\nBottom line...while the Paris has only been open since 1999, it really hasn't made the jump successfully into the 21st Century.  However, if you're looking for a low-cost, no-frills place to crash in Vegas, the Paris will scratch that itch.  If you want something more, like a comfortable bed, then most definitely go somewhere else.\n",

I ordered the granola cereal, and fruit which turned out to be a very large bowl of fresh granola with great tasting fruit water melon, black berries, blue berries, banana, raspberries, and pineapple all were fresh and quite tasty!\\nI also got my partner the special granola and peach pancake which I tasted and we agreed was fantastic and way too much!\\nThe service was excellent and met all my needs without asking!\\nI really like the idea of not only following status quo for the usual routine breakfast food, I like the clever progressive options also on their menu!  \\nLook forward to my next visit!\n",

I would defiantly go back and try some other offerings. great value!\n",

The shelves are jumbled and hard to navigate and if you aren't a man, do not expect any assistance from the cashier.  She was NOT happy to have women in her shop.\\n\\nIf I didn't need something specific while I was in AZ for a dish I was making for my hostess I would have walked right back out.  Normally in a small shop like this I would show my support and do some shopping, but not this time.\\n\\nI am SO GLAD I do not live here I won't be needing to come back here anytime soon.  Plus the place just looked dirty.\n",

I felt like I was breathing cancer everytime I walked into our room. I was so over it we cancelled our last night and left early. \\n\\nThe african-american girl at the front desk couldn't have been more confrontational and uninformed about everything she was doing on numerous occasions. Booking, calling a taxi, etc. \\nThe manager during the day was helpful to a point.\\n\\nI wouldn't reccommend staying here unless you have to. There are so many more fun places to stay in Vegas, and nicer too.\n",
